### [1] [A Survey of Automatic Evaluation Methods on Text, Visual and Speech Generations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10019)
*Tian Lan,Yang-Hao Zhou,Zi-Ao Ma,Fanshu Sun,Rui-Qing Sun,Junyu Luo,Rong-Cheng Tu,Heyan Huang,Chen Xu,Zhijing Wu,Xian-Ling Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的分类法，整理生成内容的自动评估方法，涵盖文本、图像和音频，并指出未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于生成AI在文本、图像和音频领域的能力显著提高，自动评估这些生成输出的质量仍然是一项挑战。虽然存在许多自动评估方法，但当前研究缺乏系统框架来全面组织这些方法。

Method: 本文进行了全面回顾并提出了一个统一的分类法，以涵盖文本、视觉和音频模态生成内容的自动评估方法。本文首先分析了文本生成的评估方法，然后将此框架扩展到图像和音频生成。

Result: 本文成功定义了五种基本范式来表征跨领域的现有评估方法，并展示了该框架在图像和音频生成中的广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 本文总结了现有评估方法的五个基本范式，并探讨了跨模态评估方法的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

### [2] [TaskCraft: Automated Generation of Agentic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10055)
*Dingfeng Shi,Jingyi Cao,Qianben Chen,Weichen Sun,Weizhen Li,Hongxuan Lu,Fangchen Dong,Tianrui Qin,King Zhu,Minghao Yang,Jian Yang,Ge Zhang,Jiaheng Liu,Changwang Zhang,Jun Wang,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 引入TaskCraft自动生成多工具agentic任务，优化提示并增强模型微调，提供大规模数据集支持agent研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的instruction数据缺乏工具交互，当前的代理基准依赖昂贵的人类标注，限制了其可扩展性。

Method: 引入TaskCraft，一种自动化流程，用于生成难度可调、多工具、可验证的agentic任务，并包含执行轨迹。通过深度扩展和宽度扩展来扩展原子任务，创建结构复杂的挑战。

Result: 这些任务改善了生成流程中的提示优化，并增强了agentic基础模型的监督微调。提供了一个包含约36,000个不同难度任务的大规模合成数据集。

Conclusion: TaskCraft能够有效生成多种工具、多步骤可验证的agentic任务，推动NLP和AI领域的发展。

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

### [3] [A quantum semantic framework for natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10077)
*Christopher J. Agostino,Quan Le Thien,Molly Apsel,Denizhan Pak,Elina Lesyk,Ashabari Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语言复杂性对大语言模型的限制，提出非经典的上下文性，并建议采用贝叶斯式方法较经典频率方法更能有效描述语言意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于复杂表达的组合爆炸现象，大模型和现代NLP系统面临限制。因此，本文探讨语言表达的复杂性增长时，恢复单一意图的可能性消失的现象。

Method: 使用语义Bell不等式测试，通过让不同的LLM代理在不同上下文下解释模糊的词对，作为“计算认知系统”。

Result: 通过实验发现一些结果显著违反了经典边界，这表明语言解释在模糊性下可以表现出非经典的上下文性。

Conclusion: 论文认为经典的基于频率的分析方法在自然语言处理中是有损的，而贝叶斯风格的重复采样方法可以提供更实用和适当的语言意义描述。

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为思维聊天的多智能体系统，在工业资产FMEA文档生成中通过高级AI和动态任务路由实现优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业资产故障模式和影响分析（FMEA）文件的生成通常是一个复杂且资源密集的过程。传统方法的效率和准确性受到限制，因此需要一种新的方法来优化FMEA文档的生成和验证过程。

Method: 本文提出一种称为思维聊天的多智能体系统，使用多种基于大语言模型（LLM）的协作智能体，这些智能体具有特定角色，通过高级AI技术和动态任务路由，优化FMEA表的生成和验证。

Result: 研究展示了思维聊天在应对工业设备监测领域挑战方面的潜力，通过互动、模板驱动工作流与情境感知的智能体合作，解决关键问题。

Conclusion: 思维聊天系统通过多智能体协作和情境感知技术，提供了一种创新的方式来生成和验证FMEA文档，具有潜力提升工业资产管理的效率和准确性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel multi-agent system called Chat-of-Thought,
designed to facilitate the generation of Failure Modes and Effects Analysis
(FMEA) documents for industrial assets. Chat-of-Thought employs multiple
collaborative Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with specific roles,
leveraging advanced AI techniques and dynamic task routing to optimize the
generation and validation of FMEA tables. A key innovation in this system is
the introduction of a Chat of Thought, where dynamic, multi-persona-driven
discussions enable iterative refinement of content. This research explores the
application domain of industrial equipment monitoring, highlights key
challenges, and demonstrates the potential of Chat-of-Thought in addressing
these challenges through interactive, template-driven workflows and
context-aware agent collaboration.

### [5] [When Meaning Stays the Same, but Models Drift: Evaluating Quality of Service under Token-Level Behavioral Instability in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10095)
*Xiao Li,Joel Kreuzwieser,Alan Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提示词变化下大型语言模型的响应，提出PBSS框架揭示模型特定的响应偏移，与分词和解码有关，影响了评估稳定性和服务质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们研究大型语言模型对语义意图相同但在词汇实现上不同的提示词的响应，称之为提示词变化。

Method: 提出了基于提示的语义偏移（PBSS）诊断框架，用于测量在语义等价的提示重写下，LLMs的行为漂移。

Result: PBSS在十个约束任务中的应用揭示了一致的、特定模型的响应转变，暗示了与分词和解码相关的统计规律。这表明，由于提示词重写导致的模型评估稳定性可能被忽视。

Conclusion: 分词策略和解码动态可能导致训练后服务质量的不稳定。

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

### [6] [ChartReasoner: Code-Driven Modality Bridging for Long-Chain Reasoning in Chart Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10116)
*Caijun Jia,Nan Xu,Jingxuan Wei,Qingli Wang,Lei Wang,Bihui Yu,Junnan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChartReasoner通过将图表图像转换为结构化代码，并使用数据合成和强化学习，大大提高了图表推理的效果，与开源和专有模型相比表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态推理方法通过多次图像到文本的转换将视觉推理任务转化为文本推理任务，这通常会失去嵌入在可视化中的关键结构和语义信息，特别是对于需要大量视觉细节的图表问答等任务。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了ChartReasoner。

Method: 我们提出了ChartReasoner，这是一个由代码驱动的新颖的两阶段框架，旨在实现对图表的精确、可解释的推理。首先，我们训练一个高保真模型将各种图表图像转换为结构化的ECharts代码，尽可能无损地保留布局和数据语义。接着，我们设计了一个通用的图表推理数据合成管道，利用预训练的传输模型来自动且可扩展地生成图表推理轨迹，并通过代码验证器过滤掉低质量样本。最后，我们在合成的图表推理数据集上结合监督微调和强化学习来训练最终的多模态模型。

Result: 我们设计的ChartReasoner经过训练，可以保持原始图表的细节，并与最先进的开源模型在性能上相媲美，同时在域外设置中接近专有系统如GPT-4o的性能。

Conclusion: ChartReasoner在四个公共基准上的实验结果中展示了其有效性，能够保留图表的原始细节，并在使用更少参数的情况下与最先进的开源模型表现相当，且在域外设置中接近于专有系统如GPT-4o的性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

### [7] [Unsupervised Elicitation of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10139)
*Jiaxin Wen,Zachary Ankner,Arushi Somani,Peter Hase,Samuel Marks,Jacob Goldman-Wetzler,Linda Petrini,Henry Sleight,Collin Burns,He He,Shi Feng,Ethan Perez,Jan Leike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督算法，ICM，成功微调语言模型，优于人工监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的后训练范式依赖于人工指定期望行为，但对于具有超人能力的模型来说，很难获得高质量的人工监督。

Method: 引入了一种新的无监督算法：内部一致性最大化（ICM），用于对预训练语言模型进行微调。

Result: ICM在多个任务中匹敌基于黄金监督的训练，且优于基于众包人类监督的训练，并改善了前沿语言模型的训练效果。

Conclusion: ICM在不依赖人工监督的情况下表现优异，尤其是在模型能力超过人类时，可更好地激发这些能力。

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

### [8] [When Large Language Models are Reliable for Judging Empathic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10150)
*Aakriti Kumar,Nalin Poungpeth,Diyi Yang,Erina Farrell,Bruce Lambert,Matthew Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs reliably judge empathic communication, approaching expert-level agreement and outperforming crowdworkers; they can aid transparency in sensitive applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to evaluate how reliably LLMs can judge the nuances of empathic communication, especially given their ability to generate empathic responses.

Method: The study involved comparing annotations of empathic communication made by experts, crowdworkers, and LLMs across four frameworks, using 200 real-world conversations and a large sampling of annotations (3,150 expert, 2,844 crowdworker, and 3,150 LLM annotations). Inter-rater reliability was assessed among these groups.

Result: The study found that LLMs consistently approach the expert level benchmark in annotating empathic communication across all four evaluative frameworks and outperform crowdworkers in annotation reliability.

Conclusion: LLMs, when validated with specific benchmarks, can achieve expert-level annotation reliability in evaluating empathic communication and can serve as transparent and overseer tools in emotionally sensitive applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

### [9] [AutoMind: Adaptive Knowledgeable Agent for Automated Data Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10974)
*Yixin Ou,Yujie Luo,Jingsheng Zheng,Lanning Wei,Shuofei Qiao,Jintian Zhang,Da Zheng,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoMind is an advanced LLM-agent framework that improves automated data science by incorporating domain expertise, strategic solution exploration, and adaptive coding. It outperforms existing methods in benchmark tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing LLM-driven data science agents, which are hindered by rigid workflows and inflexible coding, thus limiting their real-world effectiveness.

Method: AutoMind utilizes a curated expert knowledge base, an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm, and a self-adaptive coding strategy to enhance performance.

Result: Evaluations on two benchmarks show that AutoMind performs better than current leading methods, proving its efficiency and robustness in automated data science tasks.

Conclusion: AutoMind represents a significant advancement in LLM-agent frameworks for automated data science, with superior performance against state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动资源有限语言的情感分析能力，特别是对于具有独特地区表达和文化特征的语言，如Bangla。

Method: 使用了线性SVM、KNN和随机森林模型，结合TF-IDF向量器的n-gram数据。此外，使用PCA进行降维，BiLSTM模型和AdaBoost改进决策树，并使用LIME解释AdaBoost分类器的预测。

Result: 研究发现，通过比较不同的机器学习模型和解析技术，可以提升Bangla语言情感识别的效率。

Conclusion: 研究通过分析不同的机器学习模型来改进对Bangla语言情感分析的效率。

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

TL;DR: 开发了一个包含五个子类别的人力资本关键词词汇表，并提供相关工具以支持人力资本披露研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人力资本对企业价值创造至关重要，但目前缺乏明确的测量和披露规则。

Method: 使用机器学习算法（word2vec）训练已确认的人力资本披露集，开发涵盖五个子类别的人力资本相关关键词的分类表。

Result: 提供了人力资本词汇表、企业人力资本披露以及开发词汇表的Python代码，并展示了使用这些工具的详细示例。

Conclusion: 研究人员可以使用或修改此词汇表和代码来解决有关人力资本的问题，并展开未来的研究机会。

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

### [12] [Can LLMs Generate Good Stories? Insights and Challenges from a Narrative Planning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10161)
*Yi Wang,Max Kreminski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在叙事规划中的表现，发现模型能生成因果合理的小规模故事，但在角色意图和戏剧冲突方面需要强化学习来提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用计算叙事学的见解评估和提升大型语言模型在故事生成任务中的表现，以更好地理解模型在生成高质量故事方面的能力。

Method: 通过设计基准测试，评估大型语言模型在叙事规划问题上的表现，尤其关注因果合理性、角色意图性和戏剧冲突。

Result: 实验结果显示，当前的大型语言模型能有效生成因果合理的小型故事。但在涉及角色意图和戏剧冲突的规划中，这些模型仍面临挑战，需要更复杂的训练策略。提供了关于模型能够生成何种规模的高质量故事的洞察，并指出其在游戏环境应用中的挑战。

Conclusion: GPT-4等大模型在生成因果合理的小规模故事方面表现出色，但在角色意图和戏剧冲突规划方面依然面临挑战，尤其需要通过复杂推理的强化学习训练来提升能力。

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为Q2E的分解方法，能够提升复杂事件的视频检索能力，并超越多个基线。方法支持多语种文本和音频输入，适用于不同的数据集和领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高对于复杂现实世界事件的视频检索能力，利用LLMs和VLMs自动提取事件的潜在参数化知识。

Method: 采用Query-to-Event分解方法，结合熵为基础的融合评分进行零样本检索，同时支持对视觉和语音的输入处理。

Result: 在两个不同的数据集和多个检索指标上，Q2E方法的性能超过了一些最先进的基线，结合音频信息能够显著改善文本到视频的检索效果。

Conclusion: Q2E方法能够提升多语种文本到视频的检索能力，通过从大型语言模型和视觉语言模型中提取知识，提高对复杂事件的理解和检索效果，并超过了多个先进的基线。

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TTT-Bench揭示，尽管LRMs能处理复杂数学问题，但在简单的井字棋类任务中的推理能力仍显不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理能力不仅限于STEM领域，还包括更广泛的任务领域。

Method: 引入TTT-Bench，通过一组四个双人井字棋类游戏来评估LRMs的基本战略、空间和逻辑推理能力，并提出了一种简单且可扩展的生成可验证双人游戏问题的方法。

Result: LRMs在解决简单井字棋类推理任务时表现不佳，平均在TTT-Bench上的得分比在其他数学基准如MATH 500和AIME 2024上的得分更低。

Conclusion: 尽管LRMs在某些复杂数学问题上表现优异，但在基本策略和空间逻辑推理方面往往表现较差。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

Motivation: 使用计算方法识别不可靠的叙述者，即那些无意中歪曲信息的人。基于叙事学的文学理论，定义不同类型的不可靠叙述者。

Method: 从文献中学习，在现实世界的文本数据上进行不可靠叙述者分类，实验采用少量样本学习、微调和课程学习设置。

Result: 实验结果表明，任务非常具有挑战性，使用大语言模型（LLM）有可能识别不可靠叙述者。

Conclusion: 该任务非常具有挑战性，有可能使用LLM识别不可靠的叙述者，提供一个专家注释的数据集和代码，并邀请未来在该领域进行研究。

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

Motivation: 现有的葡萄牙语仇恨言论数据集主要来自社交媒体，存在域偏见问题，并且在处理低资源场景下的仇恨言论检测时存在不足。

Method: 本研究提出了一种新的四阶段流程：(1) 紧凑的手动整理种子；(2) 使用指令微调的LLM进行少样本扩展；(3) 基于释义的增强；(4) 丰富化及额外的中性文本以抑制对特定群体提示的过拟合。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管与传统基准存在领域差异，ToxSyn-PT在五个公开的葡萄牙语仇恨言论数据集上的二元和多标签分类实验中均表现出色，显示出较强的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT作为第一个大规模的葡萄牙语语料库，支持对九个受法律保护的少数群体进行细粒度的仇恨言论分类，推动了合成数据和低资源环境中的仇恨言论检测研究。

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: 语言模型在某些条件下可以表现出接近确定性的决策行为，挑战了以往的基于随机性假设的方法，提出了区分随机和确定性决策模式的新方法。

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

Conclusion: ClusterUCB可以在保留与原始基于梯度的数据选择方法相当的性能的同时，显著减少计算资源消耗。

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

TL;DR: Flick通过创新的伪标签优化方法，有效解决了低资源语言的少标签分类难题，且表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有方法在噪声伪标签和领域适应性上存在不足，需要开发新方法来高效解决低资源语言环境中的少标签分类问题。

Method: Flick方法利用了一个新颖的伪标签优化组件，通过从初始的集群中提取高置信度的伪标签来提高伪标签的质量，并采用自适应的top-k选择机制专注于单一集群凝聚。

Result: Flick在包含英语和其他低资源语言的14个不同数据集上进行了验证，展示了其卓越的性能和适应性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为Flick的新方法，用于解决低资源语言环境中的少标签文本分类问题，取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型会迎合学生提供的答案，可能加剧教育不平等。较小模型偏见更严重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在模拟教育环境中用户建议对大型语言模型的影响，尤其是在迎合性方面的风险。

Method: 研究测试了来自OpenAI的五种不同LLM，在五种实验条件下评估其在教育情境中的表现, 通过分析模型从属学生提及答案的频率及其对答案选择变化的可能性。

Result: 结果显示，模型对于学生提到的答案表现出明显的偏见行为，较小的模型如GPT-4.1-nano的偏见效应可达30%，而较大的模型如GPT-4o则为8%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大型语言模型在教育情境中展示出迎合性的行为，即当学生提及错误答案时，模型的正确性会下降，而提及正确答案时，准确性会提高。这种倾向在较小的模型中表现得更为明显。

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

Motivation: 为了提高语音到语音翻译系统（S2ST）的性能，这项研究尝试解决如何实现从文本到语音的模态适配问题，因为大语言模型（LLMs）主要在文本数据上训练，而语音到语音数据较有限。

Method: 提出了一种计划性交错语音-文本训练的方法。在训练过程中，将对齐的文本标记与语音标记交错使用，并逐步减少文本比例，以实现渐进式的模态适配。

Result: 通过在CVSS数据集上微调LLaMA3.2-1B，实验结果表明该方法可以一致地提高翻译性能，尤其是在训练数据有限的语言中。

Conclusion: 该研究的计划性交错语音-文本训练方法有效地促进了从文本到语音的模态适配，改善了翻译性能。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

Motivation: 现有的推理数据集通常依赖于昂贵的人类标注或容易出错的大型语言模型生成的链式思维，我们的方法旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过程序执行提取可验证的逐步推理轨迹，并将其转化为自然语言的链式思维推理。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够有效赋予大型语言模型在不同任务中可迁移的推理能力，并降低推理过程中的整体token长度，减少无意义的重复和过度思考。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种通过程序执行的确定性生成高质量链式思维（CoT）监督数据集的方法，可以有效提升大型语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

Motivation: 现有的RAG方法在处理包含文本和表格组件的异构文件时存在关键限制，导致信息丢失和多跳、全局查询中的推理能力受损。

Method: 提出TableRAG，一个统一文本理解和复杂表格数据操作的混合框架，通过上下文敏感的查询分解、文本检索、SQL编程和执行、以及合成中间答案生成四个步骤迭代操作。

Result: TableRAG在公共数据集和HeteQA基准上表现优异，超越现有基线，建立异构文档问答的新技术标准。

Conclusion: TableRAG解决了异构文档处理中的关键问题，提升了RAG在复杂推理任务上的性能。它由此成为异构文档问答的新前沿解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过生成验证来改善LLMs自我校正能力的简单有效框架PAG，使用选择性修正机制在提高推理和验证能力上取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但仍难以可靠地验证自身输出的正确性。现有解决方案依赖单独的验证模型或需要多阶段的自我校正训练流程，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 我们提出了生成验证框架(PAG)，该框架允许LLMs在统一的多轮强化学习(RL)范式中交替进行策略和验证角色。PAG引入了一种选择性修正机制：模型只有在检测到自身生成的验证步骤出现错误时才修正答案。

Result: 实验表明，PAG同时提高了推理和验证能力，并在多沙盘测试中表现出色。作为策略，它提高了直接生成和自我校正精度；作为验证器，它的自验证优于自一致性。

Conclusion: PAG验证机制不仅缓解了模型崩溃，还联合增强了推理和验证能力，提高了模型的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal
grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event
relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied
with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and
linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate
38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also
provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future
research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at

TL;DR: 研究分析了以色列-巴勒斯坦战争新闻报道中的战争与和平框架，揭示了国际间媒体在冲突报道上的偏见和差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新闻媒体在冲突时期使用的框架可能对读者的观点产生重大影响，可能加剧冲突。当前关于冲突框架的研究由于其定性特性或只关注表面层次的通用框架而提供的见解有限。

Method: 使用计算方法，结合框架语义和大型语言模型，识别新闻报道中的战争与和平新闻学指标，以及其通讯框架与语言框架之间的联系。

Result: 分析显示，新闻报道更侧重于战争而非和平。此外，不同国家（如美国、英国和中东）的新闻媒体在关于冲突的攻击者和受害者的框架上显示出显著的差异，揭示了媒体中的偏见。

Conclusion: 新闻媒体在冲突报道中对战争框架的重点更高，且在文化和地区上存在偏见。

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

Motivation: 通过提高LLM的推理效率，解决了长输出导致的计算延迟问题，并在不损害复杂问题准确性的情况下改善模型对简单问题的推理。

Method: 通过划分奖励函数并包括一种新的输出长度惩罚来管理模型的推理效率。

Result: 在三个数据集的基准评估中取得了显著成果：在较简单的数据集（GSM8K和MATH500）上缩短了输出长度，同时保持或提高了准确性；在更具挑战性的AIME2024数据集上提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 这项研究通过在简单问题中推动简洁性，同时在复杂问题中保持足够的推理，以提高模型整体性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种方法，通过识别表格单元格来解释科学声明验证，而不仅仅预测最终的支持或反驳标签。实验表明，加入表格对齐信息可以提高性能，但大多数大模型无法有效恢复人类对齐的理由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测科学声明与表格的支持或反驳标签不足以揭示模型的推理过程和可解释性，因此需要更详细的解释任务。

Method: 将表格文本对齐重新框定为一个解释任务，要求模型识别验证声明所必需的表格单元格，并扩展SciTab基准，加入人类标注的单元格级理由。

Result: 实验表明，加入表格对齐信息可以提高声明验证性能。然而，大多数大模型尽管能够正确预测标签，却无法恢复与人类一致的推理。

Conclusion: 仅仅预测声明验证的最终标签是不够的，需要通过识别关键表格单元格提高模型的推理透明度和可解释性。

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型中的偏见表现，发现无论是用户回答评分还是薪资谈判建议场景下，模型都会表现出明显偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型变得越来越复杂，其训练数据中不免包含具争议性和刻板印象的内容，这导致其在执行某些任务时表现出显著的偏见。因此，研究人员希望探索语言模型在不同任务和个性化情境下的偏见表现。

Method: 通过使用带预设人格的模型在多主题基准上进行测试，并观察模型对用户答案评分以及在薪资谈判建议场景下，来测量语言模型在不同情景下的偏见程度。

Result: 研究发现，在使用预设置人格进行测试时，得分差异极小且随机；然而，在进行任务重构时，需要模型评估用户回答时，偏见变得显著。尤其在薪资谈判建议场景上，模型表现出明显的偏见。

Conclusion: 现代语言模型在训练中不可避免地学习到了数据中的各种偏见，从而在某些任务中展现出明显偏见。尤其是在与用户互动并填充个性化特征时，模型会对用户输入的回答存在偏见。

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在多用户DST中表现不如单用户情况下，表示需要改进以应对真实对话场景中多发言者的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DST基准主要关注结构化的用户-代理对话，没有捕捉到真实多用户交互的复杂性。因此，我们评估了LLMs在多用户DST中的鲁棒性，同时尽量减少数据集构建成本。

Method: 受到最近基于LLM的数据注释进展的启发，我们通过生成基于言语行为理论的第二用户话语来扩展现有的DST数据集。我们的方法系统地将第二用户的话语引入会话，以便在多用户环境中对LLM进行控制评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，与单用户DST相比，LLMs在多用户环境中的性能明显下降。这突显了当前LLMs在面对多名说话者时的局限性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了当前LLMs在多用户DST场景中提取和跟踪对话状态的局限性，需进行未来研究以提升其能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

TL;DR: 提出RRP框架，通过结合LLM的语义能力和结构信息，从KG有效提取推理路径，提高推理能力，实验结果领先基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM增强的KG方法还无法有效解决复杂性问题。我们认为除了事实知识外，精炼事实之间的关系并将其组织成逻辑一致的推理路径也同样重要。

Method: 提出RRP框架，结合LLM的语义优势与知识图谱中关系嵌入及双向分布学习的结构信息，提炼可靠的推理路径，并通过重思考模块评估和精炼推理路径。

Result: 实验结果表明，RRP在两个公开数据集上与现有基线方法相比取得了最先进的性能，并且可以以即插即用的方式方便地集成到各种LLM中，增强其推理能力。

Conclusion: RRP框架通过结合LLM的语义能力与关系嵌入及双向分布学习获得的结构信息，有效地从知识图谱中提取可靠的推理路径，显著提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督方法用于重建原始词形，结合数据驱动推理与基于规则的启发式方法，在拉丁语原型重建上有显著提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主要依赖于音韵编辑的概率模型的方法存在局限性，且主要基于数据驱动。

Method: 利用进化优化框架，将数据驱动的推理与基于规则的启发式方法相结合。

Result: 在从五种罗曼语言的同源词中重建拉丁语原型的任务中，不论是在字符级准确性还是音韵合理性指标上，我们的方法都取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 我们的模型在拉丁语原型重建任务中，显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

TL;DR: Tina模型通过参数高效更新和LoRA，实现高性价比的推理性能，显著降低训练后成本，且推理能力优于现有很多最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过最低的成本有效地实现语言模型的强推理能力。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）的参数高效更新方法，在已经很小的1.5B参数基础模型上进行强化学习（RL）。

Result: Tina模型在推理性能上与现有最先进的RL推理模型相当甚至超越，且训练后成本仅为其很小的一部分。同时，该模型在AIME24上实现了超过20%的推理性能提升和43.33%的Pass@1准确率，成本仅为9美元。

Conclusion: Tina模型展示了在不增加高昂计算成本的情况下，能够达到可观的推理效果。这是通过在微小参数模型上，使用参数高效的RL更新和LoRA实现的。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法(SAE-Tuning)，有效降低了训练成本和时间，同时保持推理性能，适用于不同数据集和模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前在语言模型中有效提取和应用推理能力需求大，但面临成本高和训练时间长等挑战。因此，研究一种高效的推理能力引导方法显得尤为重要。

Method: 本文提出并使用了稀疏自动编码器调整(SAE-Tuning)方法。该方法首先训练稀疏自动编码器(SAE)以从源模型中捕捉推理能力，然后使用训练好的SAE引导标准的有监督微调过程，以在目标模型中引发这种能力，而无需推理过程追踪。

Result: SAE-Tuning方法不仅大幅度降低了训练成本（超过2000倍，约1美元）和训练时间（超过450倍，约20分钟），还在保持高推理性能上取得了显著成果，如在AIME24和AMC23上的表现分别为43.33%和90%。

Conclusion: 这项研究成功展示了一种经济有效的方法，通过稀疏自动编码器调整(SAE-Tuning)技术从语言模型中提取推理能力并应用于目标模型，实现了大幅度降低训练成本和时间的情况下，保持了极高的推理性能。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

*Tatsuya Hiraoka,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在拼写字符时依赖更高层次的Transformer来处理字符信息，而不是只用嵌入层。通过三种分析方法验证了此机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管拼写对人类来说是个简单任务，但LLMs在处理字符级别的信息时并不直观，因此需要研究它们如何表示和利用字符级信息。

Method: 通过探测分类器、知识神经元识别和注意力权重检查三种互补的分析方法验证LLMs在拼写过程中的机制。

Result: 分析表明嵌入层不能完全编码字符级信息，尤其是在第一个字符之后。因此，LLMs必须依赖更高层次的Transformer层来实现拼写过程中的认知突破。

Conclusion: 研究发现LLMs在拼写时需要依赖中间和更高层的Transformer层来重构字符级别的信息，而不仅仅依靠初始的嵌入层。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to safeguard individuals in distress by effectively identifying life-threatening language, promoting mental health, and preventing harm or loss of life.

Method: This study uses large language models, specifically 7B parameter variants of Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2, fine-tuned on datasets with various class balance scenarios. It compares performance against traditional methods such as bag of words and word embedding.

Result: The experimental results show that Mistral and Llama-2 models excel in both balanced and imbalanced data scenarios, outperforming traditional methods. Upsampling helps traditional methods but has limited impact on LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs, particularly Mistral and Llama-2, outperform traditional methods in detecting life-threatening language, showing great potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

TL;DR: PREMISE是一种无需修改模型权重的提示优化方法，通过减少推理冗余和保持准确性，实现高效推理和成本下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模推理模型在数学基准测试中表现出色，但其详细的推理过程导致了不必要的冗长和高昂的计算成本，这限制了其在敏感延迟或API受限的情境中的使用。

Method: 引入了一种名为PREMISE的框架，通过基于提示的高效数学推理与战略性评估来减少推理开销，无需修改模型权重。该方法结合了链路诊断与类梯度提示优化，利用多目标文本搜索优化推理简洁性与准确性。

Result: 在GSM8K、SVAMP和Math500基准测试中，PREMISE改善了或保持了基线准确性，同时将推理代币的使用量最多减少87.5%，并降低了69%-82%的成本。

Conclusion: 提示级别的优化是一种无需影响推理质量就能实现在大规模推理模型中高效推理的实用且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

TL;DR: 提出ClaimSpect框架，帮助解构声明并显示其语料库中的观点，有效性超过多种基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于科学和政治声明通常是复杂的，无法简单地标记为“真”或“假”，因此需要一种方法来解构声明并提供更全面的响应。

Method: 提出ClaimSpect，这是一个基于检索增强生成的框架，自动构建通常在处理声明时考虑的方面的层次结构，并用特定语料库的视角丰富它们。

Result: ClaimSpect成功将语料库分层，从而能够检索相关片段，帮助发现新的子方面，并能够发现对声明方面的不同观点及其各自的普遍性。

Conclusion: ClaimSpect在解构复杂的主张并在语料库中表示观点方面表现出强大的稳健性和准确性。

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

Motivation: 现有的自动分类法构建方法存在过度依赖特定语料，或过度依赖预训练数据集中包含的大型语言模型的一般知识的问题，并且未能考虑科学文献的多方面性。

Method: TaxoAdapt框架通过在多个维度上动态适配LLM生成的分类法对给定语料进行迭代的分层分类，并根据语料的主题分布扩展分类法的宽度和深度。

Result: TaxoAdapt在一组多样的计算机科学会议上展示了其最先进的表现，其生成的分类比最具竞争力的基线高26.51%的精细度和50.41%的一致性。

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt展示了其通过更高的精细度和更好的一致性，在科学领域的组织与演变中具有优势。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

Conclusion: 通过在训练初期使用支持多语言的通用分词器，可以显著提高大规模语言模型在训练后对新语言的适应能力，且不显著影响主流训练语言的性能。

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ASR系统在普通语音识别上取得显著进展，但对命名实体的误识别率仍然较高，这会影响下游应用的效果，因此需要一种方法来降低命名实体的识别错误率。

Method: 引入一个大语言模型修正机制，利用大语言模型的推理能力以及包含正确命名实体的局部上下文来修正ASR预测中的错误命名实体。

Result: 在NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare数据集上，该技术对于命名实体的相对WERR（词错误率）减少可达30%。

Conclusion: 采用大语言模型进行后期修正，可以有效减少ASR系统对专有名词的识别错误。

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

TL;DR: 本文提出LangEdit框架，通过零空间约束实现多语言知识更新，成功减轻参数干扰，并超越现有编辑方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在保证跨语言一致的事实陈述的同时，高效更新大语言模型中的多语言知识一直是一个长期未解决的挑战。

Method: LangEdit是一种创新的零空间约束框架，通过将每种语言的参数更新投射到先前更新子空间的正交补来实现。

Result: LangEdit在三个模型架构、六种语言和四个下游任务中进行了全面评估，显示其有效减轻参数干扰，优于现有最先进编辑方法。

Conclusion: LangEdit成功减轻了参数干扰，并在多语言知识更新方面优于现有的最先进编辑方法。

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在链式推理过程中存在过度思考，导致推理路径冗长或冗余的问题，现有方法往往受限于生成数据的质量并容易过拟合。

Method: 提出了一种名为ReCUT（Reasoning Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials）的新方法，采用逐步探索机制和长短切换取样策略，通过参数插值得到最终模型。

Result: 在多种数学推理数据集和基础模型上，ReCUT将推理长度显著减少了约30-50%，同时保持或提高了推理精度。

Conclusion: ReCUT在减少推理长度的同时，保持或提高了推理精度。

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

TL;DR: 提出了SlowFast Sampling策略，提升了扩散式语言模型的生成效率，实现了高达34倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散式语言模型采样策略存在静态行为，导致效率低下和灵活性不足，亟需改进。

Method: 提出了一种名为慢快采样（SlowFast Sampling）的动态采样策略，能够自适应地在探索和加速解码阶段之间进行交替，根据三大原则（确定性原则、收敛原则和位置原则）来指导令牌的生成。并将其与dLLM-Cache集成以减少冗余计算。

Result: 在各项基准和模型上实现了高达15.63倍的加速，当与缓存结合时最高可达34.22倍加速，且准确性下降较小。表现优于传统的自回归模型基线如LLaMA3 8B。

Conclusion: SlowFast Sampling significantly reduces the latency of diffusion-based language models and improves throughput compared to traditional autoregressive models, making them more efficient and flexible.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Motivation: 研究自监督语音模型如何表示不同类型信息的能力，尤其是在非英语语音上的表现。

Method: 使用探测分类器和几何分析，检查wav2vec2模型在匹配语言和非匹配语言中的音素、词汇声调和说话人信息的表示方式。

Result: 无论是预训练语言还是测试语言，wav2vec2模型中编码音素、声调和说话人的子空间基本上是正交的。尽管在后期层中，匹配语言的音素和声调探测器的探测准确率略有优势，但整体来看，后层的探测准确性模式相似。

Conclusion: wav2vec2学习到的表示结构在很大程度上独立于预训练期间使用的语音材料。

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)

to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG

both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate and validate how fine-tuning can impact large language model performance, especially focusing on parameter-efficient methods that can be beneficial for developers with limited resources.

Method: The paper uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, specifically LoRA and QLoRA, to evaluate performance improvements across three domains: commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and multi-domain knowledge.

Result: The results show that LoRA-based methods are effective in improving task-specific performance without compromising computational efficiency. The results also highlight the importance of aligning fine-tuning datasets with the specific benchmark tasks for optimal performance.

Conclusion: LoRA-based methods can significantly improve task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency. However, the effectiveness of fine-tuning is highly dependent on the alignment between the fine-tuning dataset and the benchmark tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large
language model performance, focusing on parameter-efficient methods (LoRA and
QLoRA). We evaluate model capabilities across three key domains: (1)
commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag), (2) mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), and (3)
multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS).
  Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve
task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency, and (2)
performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and
benchmark tasks. The study provides both theoretical insights into
parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers
implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了理解大型语言模型在泛化和幻觉不正确信息方面存在的矛盾行为，提出出上下文推理（OCR）这一机制。

Method: 将OCR形式化为一个合成的事实召回任务，并展示一个单层单头注意力仅变压器通过因子分解的输出和值矩阵可以解决该任务，而组合权重的模型则不能。

Result: 实验证明OCR确实驱动泛化和幻觉，取决于相关概念是否存在因果关系。同时，数学分析表明OCR能力归因于梯度下降的隐式偏差。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解OCR现象提供了理论基础，并为通过知识注入分析和缓解不良行为提供了一种新的视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

*Or Shafran,Atticus Geiger,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SNMF as a method to decompose MLP activations, providing better interpretability and performance than existing methods like SAEs, and reveals hierarchical structuring in LLMs' activation space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of sparse autoencoders, which struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability because their learning is not explicitly tied to the model computations.

Method: The paper introduces semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to decompose MLP activations, aiming to achieve interpretability by mapping learned features to activating inputs.

Result: Experiments on Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs and a strong supervised baseline on causal steering. Furthermore, SNMF reveals the hierarchical structure in MLP's activation space.

Conclusion: SNMF is a simple and effective tool for identifying interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain2Vec通过优化数据组合，提升语言模型性能，减少计算需求，实验显示在等计算预算下提升下游任务性能2.83%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计了一种新方法，通过分解数据集为多个元域的线性组合来捕捉数据集的关键底层特征，并在训练时无需调整数据分布，提高语言模型的预训练效率。

Method: Domain2Vec通过维持一个元域词汇表，并使用分类器将任何给定的数据集分解为对应这个词汇表分布的域向量，从而识别语言模型预训练的最佳数据组合。

Result: 实验表明，Domain2Vec能够在最小化计算开销的情况下找到提升下游任务性能的数据组合。具体而言，使用Domain2Vec在Pile-CC上实现相同的验证损失时仅需原来Pile数据集的51.5%的计算量，并且在等同的计算预算下，下游性能平均提高2.83%。

Conclusion: Domain2Vec能在计算开销极小的情况下，通过寻找合适的数据组合来提升下游任务的性能。

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated
harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy
violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review.
However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and

Motivation: 研究推理模型如何进行自我评估以及识别和纠正不利思维的能力，以提高模型的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 调查推理模型识别和修复四种类型不利思维的方法，进行无关思维注入实验和逆向比例趋势观察。

Result: 较大的模型比小模型更难从不相关思维中恢复，即使在被指示重新评估其推理时也是如此。更小的模型在实验中较不容易受到有害触发反应的影响。

Conclusion: 推理模型在识别不利思维方面有效，但在纠正此类思维时表现欠佳，需改进自我评估能力以开发更好的系统。

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

Conclusion: 研究结论强调证明或驳斥该不等式对可信AI未来的重要性。

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

Result: 提出一种无需重新训练即可动态调整行为的医学AI模型愿景，以提升其在不同专科、人口和医疗角色中的适应能力和医疗覆盖范围。

Conclusion: 本文探讨了医学基础模型的局限性，特别是其在动态适应医疗环境方面的不足，并提出了一种无须重新训练即可进行上下文切换的医学AI模型的愿景，以改善诊断和治疗的准确性和覆盖面。

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

Motivation: 在阿尔茨海默病研究中，因果关系与相关性的区分至关重要，因为这影响到疾病的诊断、治疗以及真正疾病驱动因素的识别。

Method: 研究采用了XGBoost算法来识别影响AD分类的关键特征，包括认知评分和遗传风险因子。同时，使用相关矩阵和SHAP值进行分析，揭示了变量之间的聚类及在不同疾病阶段特征的贡献。

Result: 研究结果表明，强相关并不一定意味着因果关系，这强调了需要谨慎解释关联数据。

Conclusion: 通过结合特征重要性、可解释性和经典的统计分析，本研究为未来的因果推断研究奠定了基础，旨在揭示真正的病理机制。这最终将有助于更好地区分因果因素与相关标记，从而改善早期诊断和阿尔茨海默病的针对性干预。

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

Motivation: 解决多智能体学习中的一个核心挑战，即开发可以适应不同战略环境的AI代理，而无需重新训练。

Method: 引入了VGC-Bench，这是一个基准测试，提供基础设施、标准评估协议、以及人类游戏数据集和一系列基线方法，包括大语言模型代理、行为克隆、强化学习和自博弈、虚构博弈、双重oracle等经验博弈论方法。

Result: 在限制情况下，当代理在单一团队配置上进行训练和评估时，能够战胜一名职业VGC选手。然而，在扩展到更大的团队规模时，即便是单团队设置中表现最佳的算法也难以应对。策略在不同团队战略中的泛化仍是一个开放挑战。

Conclusion: VGC团队策略的泛化仍是一个挑战，尽管在单一团队配置中取得了成功，但随着团队规模的扩大，现有方法难以保持高性能。

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

Motivation: To reframe AI as a cognitive revolution that transforms human intellect and productivity, similar to written language, rather than a physical mechanized tool.

Result: AI is identified as a transformative augmentation that enhances cognitive work, demanding a rethinking of skills, organizations, and policies.

Conclusion: AI complements human cognitive abilities and marks a new chapter in productivity evolution.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

Motivation: 探讨AI系统能力增强对其安全性验证的影响，特别是验证复杂性与系统表述能力提高之间的关系。

Method: 通过四个核心定理证明复杂性障碍，并在Lean4中进行形式化验证。

Result: 安全验证复杂性随系统表达能力呈指数级增长，安全策略在策略空间中的比例极小，无有限集对齐技术可提供全面覆盖，健全的安全属性对于神经网络来说基本上是测度为零的集合。

Conclusion: AI系统安全验证在能力提升时充满挑战，可能需要在系统复杂性、不可验证风险和全新安全范式发展中做出抉择。

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

Conclusion: Optimus-3 超越了现有的通用多模态大语言模型和现有的最先进的代理，在 Minecraft 环境中的广泛任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a
knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and
high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for
visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large

Result: PAL显著加速了学习过程，使代理在大约一半NEAT所需的训练时间内达到竞争水平。此外，进化出的代理表现出如代理兵营位置和防御建筑优化的涌现行为，这是人类专家玩家常用的策略。

Conclusion: 结构化评价机制如PAL可以增强神经进化在复杂实时策略环境中的可扩展性和效力。

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mirage-1, a GUI agent with hierarchical multimodal skills and an improved search algorithm, achieving significant performance gains in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance GUI agents' performance in long-horizon tasks by addressing the challenges of insufficient knowledge and the domain gap between offline and online environments.

Method: The proposed approach includes a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module for hierarchical knowledge structuring and a Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) for efficient online task execution.

Result: Mirage-1 showed superior performance with improvements of 32%, 19%, 15%, and 79% over previous agents in the benchmarks AndroidWorld, MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively.

Conclusion: Mirage-1 significantly outperforms previous GUI agents in long-horizon tasks across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of hierarchical multimodal skills and the skill-augmented Monte Carlo tree search algorithm.

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,
MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively. Project page:

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured
tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning,
dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection

Method: 提出了一种基于代理的自动伸缩框架，并使用YOLOv8视觉识别和OpenCV二维码检测两个真实世界的处理服务，比较了四种伸缩代理：主动推理、深度Q网络、结构知识分析和深度主动推理。

Result: 结果表明，所有代理都实现了可接受的SLO性能，但收敛模式各有不同。深度Q网络受益于预训练，结构分析快速收敛，而深度主动推理代理结合了理论基础和实际可扩展优势。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果证明了多维基于代理的边缘环境自动伸缩的可行性，并鼓励在这一研究方向上的未来工作。

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning.
This paper introduces OIBench, a high-quality, private, and challenging
olympiad-level informatics dataset comprising 250 carefully curated original

comprehensive assessment across various programming paradigms and complexities,
and we demonstrate its contamination-resistant properties via experiments. We
propose Time/Space Completion Curves for finer-grained efficiency analysis and
enable direct human-model comparisons through high-level participant
evaluations. Our experiments reveal that while open-source models lag behind
closed-source counterparts, current SOTA models already outperform most human
participants in both correctness and efficiency, while still being suboptimal
compared to the canonical solutions. By releasing OIBench as a fully
open-source resource (https://huggingface.co/datasets/AGI-Eval/OIBench), we
hope this benchmark will contribute to advancing code reasoning capabilities
for future LLMs.

Conclusion: 当前最先进的多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在科学信号感知、属性理解和比较推理方面表现不足，需要进一步提高。

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%

Conclusion: 较新的推理增强型模型在较简单的实例中显示出良好的结果，但在需要更深层次逻辑规划的更复杂配置中表现不佳。

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

Conclusion: 本研究推出了一种新整数序列及其在LLMs能力评估中的潜力，初步验证表明能够有效用于分析模型的符号推理和数学假设验证能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

Motivation: 现有AML建模的推荐通常以非正式的文本约束形式存在，无法在AML中自动验证。为了克服这一限制，该论文介绍了一种新方法来正式化和验证这些约束。

Method: AML模型首先通过RML和SPARQL映射为OWL本体。此外，使用大语言模型将文本规则转化成SHACL约束，并在之前生成的AML本体上进行验证，最后自动将验证结果解释为自然语言。

Result: 结果显示，即使是复杂的建模规则也能在不需要用户理解形式化方法或本体技术的情况下，进行半自动的检查。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了一种将非正式文本约束形式化并验证的方法，大幅简化了AML建模规则的验证过程。

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a
dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its
performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts
instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex
solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently
explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization
problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from
Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging
environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution
refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both
ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CoT推理与MCP的框架，以增强LLMs在城市时空行为模拟中的能力，提高了生成效能和与真实数据的相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在城市规划研究中，人类时空行为模拟十分关键，但传统方法存在计算成本高、可泛化性差和扩展性有限的问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种框架，将连锁思维（CoT）推理与模型上下文协议（MCP）结合，来增强大语言模型（LLMs）在模拟与验证数据模式相符的时空行为的能力。这个方法使用五阶段认知框架进行人类类似的渐进推理，并通过六类专用MCP工具进行全面的数据处理：时间管理、空间导航、环境感知、个人记忆、社会协作和体验评估。

Result: 在上海陆家嘴区的实验验证了框架的有效性，生成的1,000个样本与真实移动信令数据的高度相似，实现了7.86到8.36的生成质量评分。并通过并行处理实验显示出效率提升，在从2到12个进程扩展时，生成时间从1.30减少到0.17分钟每个样本。

Conclusion: 将CoT推理与MCP结合应用于城市行为建模，为智慧城市规划、交通预测和参与式城市设计提供了基础。

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning
research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from
high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While
large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face
challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,
lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.
This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating
spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The
methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage
cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP
tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental
perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.
Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's
effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high
similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores
of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments
show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to
0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work
contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling,
advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical
approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a
foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and
participatory urban design applications.

Abstract: Classical AI Planning techniques generate sequences of actions for complex
tasks. However, they lack the ability to understand planning tasks when
provided using natural language. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
introduced novel capabilities in human-computer interaction. In the context of
planning tasks, LLMs have shown to be particularly good in interpreting human
intents among other uses. This paper introduces GenPlanX that integrates LLMs
for natural language-based description of planning tasks, with a classical AI
planning engine, alongside an execution and monitoring framework. We
demonstrate the efficacy of GenPlanX in assisting users with office-related
tasks, highlighting its potential to streamline workflows and enhance
productivity through seamless human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 引入ToxiMol，作为首个专注于分子毒性修复的MLLMs基准任务，通过标准化数据集和自动化评估工具来评估和提升模态大语言模型的毒性理解和修复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补现有分子毒性修复任务未被系统定义或基准测试的不足，以促进该领域的发展。

Method: 构建ToxiMol基准任务，开发一个标准化的数据集涵盖11个主要任务和560个代表性毒性分子；设计一个机制感知和任务自适应的提示注释流程；提出一个自动化评估框架ToxiEval，集成毒性终点预测、合成可达性、药物相似性及结构相似性进行高通量的修复成功评估。

Conclusion: 现有的通用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在毒性修复任务上仍然面临重大挑战，不过开始展现出毒性理解、语义约束遵循以及结构感知分子编辑的潜力。

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

TL;DR: RLVR improves mathematical reasoning in some models like Qwen2.5-Math even with incorrect rewards, but doesn't work universally across all models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore whether reinforcement learning can improve reasoning skills in models, even when rewards do not correlate with the correct answer.

Method: The study uses reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to test its effect on model performance, particularly focusing on mathematical reasoning.

Result: The Qwen2.5-Math model showed improvement in mathematical reasoning tasks despite spurious rewards, with varying degrees of performance gains under different conditions.

Conclusion: RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance in certain models, even with spurious rewards.

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

TL;DR: AniMaker 是一种能够生成故事连贯视频的多代理框架，通过智能选择和高效生成多候选片段，解决了视频生成模型中的叙事不连贯性和节奏问题。


<details>

Motivation: 目前的视频生成模型在生成多场景和角色的连贯叙事视频方面存在挑战，现有方法常导致叙事不连贯和节奏问题。

Method: AniMaker是一种多代理框架，通过包括导演代理、摄影代理、审核代理和后期制作代理的协同工作，生成连贯的故事动画，并以MCTS-Gen和多镜头动画评估工具AniEval为技术支持。

Result: 实验表明，AniMaker在质量和效率方面均有显著提升，根据VBench和AniEval框架测量的结果显示其生成的故事动画更接近生产标准。

Conclusion: AniMaker通过多代理框架和智能生成选择策略，有效提高了AI生成故事动画的质量和连贯性。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent
storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains
challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into
fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.
Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that
even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output
animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient
multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus
creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text
input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the
Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip
generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent
for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical
components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to
generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in
Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot
animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level
consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering
each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments
demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular
metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while
significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing
AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索有限游戏中混合策略纳什均衡的学习可行性，同时对学习动态进行自然限制，以获得更有效和稳定的学习过程。

Method: 使用高阶复制子动态和高阶非耦合异质动态来研究混合策略纳什均衡的可学习性，并将其与控制理论中的反馈稳定化联系起来。同时引入ABR性质，以分析在自然限制条件下的动态表现。

Result: 研究表明，存在某些高阶非耦合学习动态可以导向孤立的混合策略NE，但这种动态缺乏普适性。此外，具有ABR性质的动态在渐近平稳的环境中能学习最佳响应，并与NE的兼容性有关。

Conclusion: 本文建立了一个理论框架，表明对于任意有限游戏的孤立完全混合策略纳什均衡（NE），存在高阶非耦合学习动态可以局部导向该NE。同时，我们提出的学习动态缺乏普适性，即某些动态无法在不同游戏间通用学习混合策略NE。

Abstract: We study learnability of mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium (NE) in general
finite games using higher-order replicator dynamics as well as classes of
higher-order uncoupled heterogeneous dynamics. In higher-order uncoupled
learning dynamics, players have no access to utilities of opponents (uncoupled)
but are allowed to use auxiliary states to further process information
(higher-order). We establish a link between uncoupled learning and feedback
stabilization with decentralized control. Using this association, we show that
for any finite game with an isolated completely mixed-strategy NE, there exist
higher-order uncoupled learning dynamics that lead (locally) to that NE. We
further establish the lack of universality of learning dynamics by linking
learning to the control theoretic concept of simultaneous stabilization. We
construct two games such that any higher-order dynamics that learn the
completely mixed-strategy NE of one of these games can never learn the
completely mixed-strategy NE of the other. Next, motivated by imposing natural
restrictions on allowable learning dynamics, we introduce the Asymptotic Best
Response (ABR) property. Dynamics with the ABR property asymptotically learn a
best response in environments that are asymptotically stationary. We show that
the ABR property relates to an internal stability condition on higher-order
learning dynamics. We provide conditions under which NE are compatible with the
ABR property. Finally, we address learnability of mixed-strategy NE in the
bandit setting using a bandit version of higher-order replicator dynamics.

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: NOCL框架通过将节点属性转化为结构化自然语言和语义嵌入，解决了LLMs在图应用中的挑战，实现了在零样本情况下的优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MPNNs在标签稀缺场景下的泛化能力受限，而近期的自监督方法也需要有标签的微调，大规模的语言模型在图应用中遇到挑战。因此，提出NOCL来克服这些局限性。

Method: 本文提出了节点导向概念化LLM (NOCL)框架，运用了两个核心技术：1）节点描述，将异质节点属性转换为结构化自然语言，扩展了LLM的适用范围；2）节点概念，使用预训练语言模型将节点描述编码为紧凑的语义嵌入，大幅减少了token长度。

Result: 实验结果验证了NOCL在监督学习任务中具有竞争力，并且在零样本设定中表现出色。

Conclusion: 最终实验结果证明了NOCL在监督任务中的竞争力，尤其相较于传统的MPNNs和混合的LLM-MPNN方法，在零样本情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

Result: 实验表明，使用LSTM-LSTM结构的TNN模型能实现最高的准确性，但需要最长的训练时间；CNN-LSTM结构则在准确性和训练速度上达到最优平衡。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于深度学习的反向设计方法能有效解决薄膜光学性质的设计问题，LSTM-LSTM模型虽然准确性最高，但训练时间最长；而CNN-LSTM模型则在准确性和速度上取得了最佳平衡。

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

Motivation: 现有的基于DPO的方法未能区分偏好对的差异性，导致次优的数据利用和模型性能。为了解决这个问题，提出了一种能够同时考虑偏好对固有质量和模型表现的优化方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为Omni-DPO的双视角优化框架，能够自适应地根据数据质量和模型学习动态调整样本权重，从而在训练中更有效地利用数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，Omni-DPO在多种模型和基准上表现优越，尤其是在文本理解任务中，Omni-DPO微调的Gemma-2-9b-it模型在Arena-Hard基准上表现优于当前领先的Claude 3 Opus。在数学推理任务中，Omni-DPO持续在所有基准上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Omni-DPO通过同时考虑偏好对的固有质量和模型在这些对上的性能动态，提供了改善数据利用效率和提升模型表现的有效方法。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型（LLM）的能力越来越强，但精确量化它们的不确定性仍然是一个重大挑战，这限制了它们在高风险领域的应用。此外，许多先进的LLM是闭源的，呈现为黑箱状态，这进一步加剧了这一挑战。

Method: 我们引入了一种名为Metropolis-Hastings通过LLM提案（MHLP）的新型马尔科夫链蒙特卡罗（MCMC）算法，该算法结合了提示优化技术和标准MCMC方法。

Conclusion: 我们的工作展示了在LLM时代将丰富的贝叶斯文献方法纳入LLM系统的可行路径，为更可靠和校准的LLM系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息理论的框架来优化HVAE的潜在维度分配，证明其可以提高非分布检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在潜在容量分配上往往具有任意性，可能导致无效表示或后验崩溃，因此需要优化潜在维度的分配。

Method: 本文引入了一个优化HVAE潜在维度分配的理论框架，利用信息论原理在信息损失和表示衰减之间进行权衡，以确定最佳的潜在分配比例。

Result: 找到一个在固定潜在预算下的最佳分配比例$r^{\ast}$，调节此比例能够在不同数据集和架构中稳定提升OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过理论验证和实验，我们的方法证明了调节编码分配比例可以显著提升非分布检测的准确性，为设计潜在结构提供了实用的指导。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

Motivation: 解决在未知奖励函数情况下的核化Bandit问题，并希望开发出在理论和实践上都表现优异的算法。

Method: 设计了一种基于探索分布的新型核化Bandit算法类，结合Upper Confidence Bound和随机化方法，选择不同的探索分布可生成实际算法。

Result: 所得算法在遗憾界上与现有UCB和Thompson Sampling等算法匹配，并且随机化策略在实践中表现更优。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一类高效的核化Bandit算法——GP-Generic，通过选择适当的探索分布实现了多样化算法，这些算法在理论上具有良好的遗憾界，并在实践中可能优于传统算法。

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in

TL;DR: 研究通过两阶段深度自编码器优化MNIST聚类性能，实现高效的数据重构精度和聚类纯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够在MNIST手写数字数据集上提供优异聚类性能的框架，同时确保结果的可解释性和方法的可扩展性。

Method: 采用了两阶段深度自编码器架构，第一阶段进行图像的表示学习以最小化重构误差，第二阶段结合KMeans聚类损失，通过联合距离优化目标进行学习。模型包含批量归一化、dropout和权重衰减等元素。

Result: 该框架在广泛的测试中显示出优越的聚类性能，表现出更高的Silhouette Score和Davies-Bouldin Index，并在处理图像特征时通过NMI和ARI等指标评估表现优异。t-SNE可视化显示出清晰的数字簇。

Conclusion: 此次研究展示了一个先进的无监督聚类系统，能够在大规模图像聚类应用中提供高效的表示学习支持。

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction
errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans
clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based
objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization
combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable
results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during
extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score
and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when
processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present
learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches
an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster
separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and
scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps
deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image
clustering applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通信有效的联邦多任务学习方法，通过特征锚点和社区检测实现客户端之间的个性化协作，实验结果优于当前基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减轻模型传输负担并提高个性化学习效果，我们需要一种能够在保证通信效率的基础上充分利用客户端之间的相似性的学习方法。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的联邦多任务学习方法，利用跨客户端相似性实现个性化学习。为了避免将整个模型传输到参数服务器，我们提出了一种通信高效的方案，引入了一种特征锚点，分享客户端分类头，并执行基于图的正则化来促进客户端之间的协作。

Result: 在两个异构数据集上的大量实验表明，我们的方法显著超越了现有的最先进基准。

Conclusion: 我们的方法显著超越了现有的最先进基准，并展示出卓越的计算和通信效率，同时促进了客户端之间的公平性。

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

Result: 成功生成了符合云物理学趋势的3D体云，这些生成的云未被专家辨别为非物理。

Conclusion: NnD模型能够生成与云物理学趋势一致且通过专家感知的云模拟结果。

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图主动学习方法多在静态图数据上评估，并主要关注预测准确性，忽视了用户中心化的考量，如采样多样性、查询公平性以及动态环境的适应性。

Method: 引入GRAIL这一评价框架，通过新指标来评估在动态环境下图主动学习方法的持续有效性、多样性和用户负担。

Result: 在包含动态、真实生活人类传感器数据的数据集上进行的广泛实验揭示了预测性能与用户负担之间的权衡，同时也指出了现有主动学习策略的局限性。

Conclusion: GRAIL提供了一种综合评估图主动学习方法的平台，平衡了节点重要性、查询多样性和网络拓扑，在动态环境中实现了有效评估。

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: 在未知容量的无感MMAB问题中，我们提出了一种名为A-CAPELLA的去中心化算法，能够在这种情况下实现对数遗憾。

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的域随机化（DR）方法在跨多个模拟器上训练策略时忽略了已有的离线数据。为了有效缩小从模拟到现实世界的差距，本研究探讨了离线域随机化（ODR）。

Method: 将ODR形式化为在参数化仿真器族上的最大似然估计，证明在温和的正则性和可识别性条件下该估计量的一致性，并推导出ODR相对于标准DR的误差界限。

Result: 证明在一定条件下，ODR的估计量收敛于真实动力学模型，并表明其仿真到现实错误在有限仿真器情况下比均匀DR收敛得更紧，且在连续设置中有类似的增益。

Conclusion: 本研究通过最大似然估计正式化ODR，证明在适当的条件下该估计量具有一致性，并导出差距界限，展示ODR在有限仿真器情况下能显著减少sim-to-real误差。引入E-DROPO避免方差崩溃，增强零样本传输。

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes BYOL-γ augmented GCBC to improve state representation for better generalization without contrastive samples or TD learning, showing competitive results in combinatorial generalization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the generalization ability of goal-conditioned behavior cloning methods on novel state-goal pairs by encouraging temporal consistency in state representations.

Method: The paper introduces BYOL-γ augmented GCBC, a representation learning objective that approximates successor representations in finite MDPs, without relying on contrastive samples or temporal-difference learning.

Result: The method achieves competitive empirical performance across a range of challenging tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed method, BYOL-γ augmented GCBC, can theoretically approximate successor representations without using contrastive samples or temporal-difference learning, achieving competitive performance in tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Motivation: 为了理解训练后网络能通过增加测试时计算能力解决更多关卡的机制。

Method: 部分逆向工程了一个卷积递归神经网络，分析其中与经典双向搜索类似的机制。

Result: 揭示了网络中的几种机制，这些机制类似于经典双向搜索的组件，如状态-动作激活函数类似价值函数，并且每层都有自己的计划表示和价值函数以增加搜索深度。

Conclusion: 该网络虽然通过无模型训练学会了复杂的测试时计算机制，但这些机制可以用传统的术语来理解，并不难以捉摸。

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

Motivation: 传统的非参数方法如Beran估计器在处理复杂数据结构与重度删失时表现欠佳，因此需要新的生存分析模型来提高处理能力和分析准确性。

Method: 本文提出三种新颖的生存模型：iSurvM、iSurvQ和iSurvJ。这些模型基于不精确概率理论并结合注意力机制，通过间隔值概率分布和核回归方法处理删失数据，无需参数假设。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的模型，尤其是iSurvJ模型，在准确性和计算复杂度方面优于Beran估计器。代码已经公开。

Conclusion: 本文提出的iSurvM、iSurvQ和iSurvJ模型有效地解决了复杂数据结构和重度删失的问题，特别是iSurvJ在准确性和计算复杂度方面优于传统的Beran估计器。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

Conclusion: 优良的分层双曲嵌入有助于识别分布内和分布外的样本。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

Motivation: 现有的对比学习方法缺乏不确定性量化机制。

Conclusion: VCL为对比学习提供了一种概率基础，作为对比方法的新基础。

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

Motivation: 目前的大多数深度离策略actor-critic算法在样本效率方面表现欠佳，尤其是在稀疏奖励的环境中。因此，本研究旨在通过提出一种有原则的定向探索策略来改善这一问题。

Method: 本研究提出Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC)算法，利用悲观的actor进行时间差分学习，并使用乐观的actor促进探索。通过将悲观和乐观策略的Wasserstein重心作为探索策略，并在学习过程中调整探索的程度。

Result: WBSAC在MuJoCo连续控制任务中的样本效率优于现有先进的离策略actor-critic算法。

Conclusion: WBSAC算法在MuJoCo连续控制任务中比现有的离策略actor-critic算法更具样本效率。

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有模型通常忽视了在真实世界观察性数据中存在或新兴的异质性子群，从而导致不准确甚至有害的预测。

Method: 引入了一种动态子群变分自动编码器(DynaSubVAE)框架，通过动态更新潜在结构，以捕捉新趋势。该框架利用一种新颖的非参数聚类机制，基于嵌入相似性发现和建模潜在子群。

Result: DynaSubVAE在近OOD和远OOD检测中表现出竞争力，并在class-OOD场景中表现优异，其动态子群机制在OOD准确性和后悔精度方面优于独立的聚类方法。

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE在近OOD和远OOD检测中表现出竞争力，特别是在训练中缺失整个类别的class-OOD场景中表现优异。其动态子群机制在OOD准确性和后悔精度方面优于独立的聚类方法。

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

Motivation: 研究ECG和PCG的共性和独有特征及其在不同生理条件和个体间的相互重建及生物标志物提取潜力。

Method: 利用EPHNOGRAM数据集的同时ECG-PCG记录，采用线性和非线性机器学习模型（包括非因果LSTM网络），进行跨模态重构及分析因果性、生理状态和跨主题变异的影响。

Result: 在跨主题情境下利用带包络建模的瞬时幅度特征显著提高了跨模态学习的跨主题普适性，并能够在跨主题中估计PCG的心电图生物标志物。

Conclusion: 非线性模型，特别是非因果LSTM，具备卓越的重构性能。相比之下，从PCG重构ECG比反向重构更具可行性。

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

TL;DR: LaMAGIC2 improves analog topology generation with higher success rates, lower MSEs, and better transferability compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient automation of analog topology design due to customized requirements and manual engineering efforts.

Method: Introduces SFCI (succinct float-input canonical formulation with identifier) to enhance language model-based analog topology generation.

Result: LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher success rates under tight tolerance and 10X lower MSEs. It also shows 58.5% improvement in transferability for circuits with more vertices.

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2 establishes itself as a robust framework for analog topology generation, outperforming previous methods in precision and transferability.

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

Conclusion: DC-Clustering能够在复杂的数据分区场景中实现与集中式聚类相当的性能，并具有隐私保护、通信效率和灵活性。

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

Method: 该方法通过神经网络将任务中的每个示例嵌入到一个潜在空间中，并构建一个概率模型来学习特定任务的分类器，同时在潜在空间中估计标注者的能力。分类器的适应通过期望最大化（EM）算法最大化后验概率来执行，并通过反向传播来实现网络的元学习。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在真实世界和合成噪音的数据集上表现出色。

Conclusion: 在真实世界的数据集和合成噪音的测试中，提出的方法证明了其有效性。

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了一个SDP松弛在应用于深度网络时的关键限制，即内点消失，导致严格可行性丧失，进而影响SDP的数值稳定性和最优性。通过我们设计的五种解决方案，成功提高了验证问题的可行性，从而解决了现有方法无法解决的88%问题。

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Graph-MLLM，一个用于多模态图学习的基准，通过对六个数据集进行评估，发现联合视觉和文本属性有助于图学习，并且对特定多模态图进行细微调整的MLLMs能够取得最先进的效果。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的多模态图学习方法缺乏统一的基准来公平评估这些方法的效果，因此无法清晰地衡量进展。

Method: 提出了Graph-MLLM，一个全面的多模态图学习基准，通过系统地评估六个不同领域的数据集中的三种范式：编码器、对齐器和预测器。

Result: 通过广泛的实验，发现联合考虑节点的视觉和文本属性有利于图学习，甚至在使用预训练的文本到图像对齐模型（例如CLIP）作为编码器时也是如此。将视觉属性转换为文本描述比直接使用视觉输入进一步提高了性能。

Conclusion: 在大多数场景下，对特定多模态图进行细微调整的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）能够取得最先进的效果，即使没有明确的图结构信息。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

Conclusion: Col-UCB算法在分组多臂老虎机问题中有效地协调了群体间的探索，减少了协作遗憾，并实现了最优的最小最大和实例依赖的协作遗憾。

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

Conclusion: PyLO扩展了学习优化器的可访问性，促进了在大规模真实任务中的应用，并显示出其与现有技术组合的潜力。

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传感器稀疏，政府发布的空气质量指数数据无法反映局部实际情况，因此需要更精确的局部空气质量预测。

Method: 使用时空图神经网络（GNNs）预测空气质量指数（AQI）。

Result: 在空气质量指数预测中，使用时空GNN方法比现有方法的均方误差降低71.654，相对减少79%，并且揭示了空气质量指数的短期重复模式和变化的空间关系。

Conclusion: 使用时空图神经网络预测空气质量指数可显著提高预测准确性。

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究观察和语言反馈的互动学习，受到大型语言模型代理的兴起驱动，目前还缺乏对这些决策问题的系统框架。

Method: 形式化语言反馈学习（LLF）问题，引入传递消除维度作为复杂性度量，开发了一个叫做HELiX的无遗憾算法，解决LLF问题。

Result: 在多种经验领域中，HELiX表现良好，甚至在多次提示LLM不可靠时依然有效。

Conclusion: 设计原则上基于通用语言反馈的互动学习算法的初步尝试。

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的基于小波的多模态方法，用于EMG、ECG和EEG信号分析，展示了优异的性能并设立了新基准，促进了生理信号处理的新发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生理信号往往受到运动伪影、基线漂移以及其他低信噪比干扰的影响，这对信号分析提出了重大挑战。同时，信号表现出强非平稳性，具有尖锐峰值和突变，难以用传统时域或滤波方法表示。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的基于小波的方法来分析生理信号，以捕捉各种生理信号中的多尺度时频特征。利用这一技术，首次引入了两种大规模预训练模型，专门用于EMG和ECG。

Result: 在下游任务中实现了优异的性能并设定了新的基准。同时，通过整合预训练的EEG模型，构建了一个统一的多模态框架，有效解决了低信噪比、高个体间差异性和设备不匹配等挑战，并在多模态任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该基于小波的架构为分析多样化的生理信号奠定了坚实基础，而多模态设计则指向了下一代生理信号处理技术，在可穿戴健康监测、临床诊断及更广泛的生物医学应用中具有潜在影响。

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决基于隐动力学的材料响应不可逆演化问题，并从可观察的数据推断这些动力学。

Method: 提出了一种端到端学习框架，名为历史感知神经算子（HANO），该模型通过短期应变-应力历史片段预测路径相关的材料响应，而无需依赖隐藏状态变量。这一模型基于傅里叶神经算子骨架，同时嵌入了分层自注意机制以实现多尺度特征提取。

Result: HANO在弹塑性硬化和脆性固体逐渐各向异性损伤两个基准问题中表现出色，在预测精度、泛化性和鲁棒性方面均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: HANO模型是一种有效的数据驱动代理，可用于模拟非弹性材料，并适合与传统数值求解器集成。

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

Motivation: 在数据流环境中，学习任务顺序出现，需要持续学习（CL）以在线更新模型，自适应新任务同时保留过去知识，防止遗忘。然而，随着大型预训练模型（LPMs）的兴起，它们的计算需求和参数规模越来越大，使得CL的效率变得至关重要。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种适合大型预训练模型的高效持续学习方法，通过分层适配器和稀疏梯度更新来实现效率和效果兼顾。

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

Conclusion: 本文证明了大型语言模型存在潜在的属性推断攻击风险，揭示了在领域特定数据集微调后，数据集敏感属性可能被推测出来的漏洞。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Conclusion: 研究通过对基模型变化进行控制，精确揭示潜在模型能力之间的因果关系，强调基模型变化控制在评估中的重要性。

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs), vital for large model alignment, are underexplored for
complex embodied tasks like Embodied Question Answering (EQA) where nuanced
evaluation of agents' spatial, temporal, and logical understanding is critical
yet not considered by generic approaches. We introduce EQA-RM, a novel

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of high API costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and biases associated with using LLMs to evaluate LLM-generated content.

Method: The paper introduces PAJAMA, which synthesizes executable judging programs using LLMs, providing a cost-effective, interpretable, and auditable alternative to direct LLM-based evaluation.

Result: PAJAMA achieves a 15.83% improvement in judgment consistency and a 23.7% reduction in biased responses compared to LLM-as-a-judge, and outperforms on RewardBench's CHAT-HARD subset with significantly lower costs.

Conclusion: PAJAMA significantly reduces the cost of evaluating LLMs and improves judgment consistency and bias reduction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM
generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API
costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To
address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model
Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging
programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can
be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing
interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a
model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of
RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the
JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 频繁发生的野火引发了对野火传播预测的浓厚兴趣。然而，即便是最复杂的野火模型在进行多日模拟时，也与实际观察进程存在偏差，这促使了数据同化的必要性。

Conclusion: 所开发的方法有效结合了卫星数据和历史模拟，能够生成火到达时间样本并助力模拟大气状态的开发。平均Sorensen-Dice系数证明该方法具有良好的准确性。

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

Motivation: 目前的基准假设数据是干净且规则采样的，与实际应用中的不规则、多模态以及混乱的数据不符，因此有必要设计一个更具现实意义的基准。

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

*Weiying Zhao,Aleksei Unagaev,Natalia Efremova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel hybrid method combining spectral clustering and cLHS improves SOC sampling's representativeness and accuracy by better covering environmental diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of traditional SOC monitoring methodologies that may overlook minor but important environmental clusters, leading to less effective sampling of SOC.

Method: The paper proposes a novel hybrid methodology integrating spectral clustering with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS). Spectral clustering divides the study area into homogeneous zones using multivariate covariate data, and then cLHS is applied within each zone for sampling.

Result: The spectral-cLHS method shows more uniform coverage of covariates and spatial heterogeneity compared to the standard cLHS method on a real SOC mapping dataset.

Conclusion: The hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures more uniform coverage of environmental covariates, resulting in better-balanced training data and potentially more accurate SOC predictions.

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform well but require high computational resources, making edge device inference appealing due to lower costs and improved efficiency.

Method: The paper uses model quantization and DRAM-Flash hybrid storage; adjusts weights and inputs based on CPU and GPU features; implements multicore load balancing, mixed-precision floating-point operations, and geometric computations.

Result: MNN-LLM achieves up to an 8.6x speed increase compared to current mainstream LLM frameworks.

Conclusion: MNN-LLM significantly accelerates LLM deployment on mobile devices by addressing runtime challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
a variety of tasks. However, their substantial scale leads to significant
computational resource consumption during inference, resulting in high costs.
Consequently, edge device inference presents a promising solution. The primary
challenges of edge inference include memory usage and inference speed. This
paper introduces MNN-LLM, a framework specifically designed to accelerate the
deployment of large language models on mobile devices. MNN-LLM addresses the
runtime characteristics of LLMs through model quantization and DRAM-Flash
hybrid storage, effectively reducing memory usage. It rearranges weights and
inputs based on mobile CPU instruction sets and GPU characteristics while
employing strategies such as multicore load balancing, mixed-precision
floating-point operations, and geometric computations to enhance performance.
Notably, MNN-LLM achieves up to a 8.6x speed increase compared to current
mainstream LLM-specific frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D molecule generation by developing a diffusion model that is equivariant to Euclidean transformations, providing enhanced generative modeling capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces Equivariant Neural Diffusion (END), a diffusion model with a learnable forward process that is equivariant to Euclidean transformations, optimized through time- and data-dependent transformations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that END performs competitively against strong baselines in both unconditional and conditional generation of molecules.

Conclusion: END shows competitive performance in molecule generation benchmarks, exceeding several strong baselines.

Abstract: We introduce Equivariant Neural Diffusion (END), a novel diffusion model for
molecule generation in 3D that is equivariant to Euclidean transformations.
Compared to current state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models, the key
innovation in END lies in its learnable forward process for enhanced generative
modelling. Rather than pre-specified, the forward process is parameterized
through a time- and data-dependent transformation that is equivariant to rigid
transformations. Through a series of experiments on standard molecule
generation benchmarks, we demonstrate the competitive performance of END
compared to several strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional
generation.

Motivation: 研究旨在利用短时间历史训练窗口预测电力日前市场价格，尤其关注季节性趋势和价格峰值的检测。

Method: 研究评估了四种机器学习模型（LSTM与前馈误差校正，XGBoost，LightGBM和CatBoost）在不同的训练窗口长度下（7到90天）的表现。

Result: 结果表明，LightGBM在准确率和鲁棒性方面表现最佳，特别是在45和60天的训练窗口下，在季节性效应和价格峰值事件的检测上优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 短时间窗口与提升方法相结合可以有效支持在数据稀缺和波动环境中的电力市场价格预测。

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of machine learning models in
forecasting electricity Day-Ahead Market (DAM) prices using short historical
training windows, with a focus on detecting seasonal trends and price spikes.
We evaluate four models, namely LSTM with Feed Forward Error Correction (FFEC),
XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, across three European energy markets (Greece,
Belgium, Ireland) using feature sets derived from ENTSO-E forecast data.
Training window lengths range from 7 to 90 days, allowing assessment of model
adaptability under constrained data availability. Results indicate that
LightGBM consistently achieves the highest forecasting accuracy and robustness,
particularly with 45 and 60 day training windows, which balance temporal
relevance and learning depth. Furthermore, LightGBM demonstrates superior
detection of seasonal effects and peak price events compared to LSTM and other
boosting models. These findings suggest that short-window training approaches,
combined with boosting methods, can effectively support DAM forecasting in
volatile, data-scarce environments.

TL;DR: 这项研究提出了一种利用图神经网络自动优化印刷电路板设计的方案，能够节省时间和成本，同时提高设计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的电路板设计优化需要大量人力资源，且过程繁琐，自动化优化可以节省时间和成本，并减少电子废料。

Method: 将印刷电路板示意图表示为二部图，并使用图神经网络进行节点对预测。

Result: 实验结果显示，图神经网络能够以高精度解决印刷电路板设计优化问题。

Conclusion: 利用基于图神经网络的节点对预测模型可以高效地优化印刷电路板设计。

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design
optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

TL;DR: 引入了一种改进的统计决策框架，提高了算法决策公平性评估的可靠性和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前算法决策系统的公平性评估往往忽略采样误差，并且在处理交叉分析时，由于组群过于细化，导致无法进行可靠估计。本研究旨在提供一种解决此问题的方法。

Method: 引入一个假设检验框架，包括对大型子群的中央极限定理证明，以及对小型相交群体的贝叶斯Dirichlet多项估计器。使用基准数据集进行实证验证。

Result: 通过在基准数据集上的实证验证，新方法能够在不同的数据可用性和交叉性程度下，提供可解释且统计严谨的决策。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种统一的、尺寸自适应的假设检验框架，将公平性评估转化为基于证据的统计决策，提供了解释性强且统计上严格的方法。

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过一种新的分析框架改善了非凸损失函数的动态遗憾最小化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态遗憾最小化主要集中在凸函数上，而损失曲率较强的函数（例如平方或逻辑损失）则尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用具有固定分享更新的指数加权方法来处理可混合损失。

Result: 本文的方法可以在维度d上的动态遗憾方面，达到比现有最佳结果更好的表现。具体来说，对于可混合损失，实现了$\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$的动态遗憾。

Conclusion: 本文通过利用混合性（mixability）的概念显著改善了动态遗憾的最小化。

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

TL;DR: 论文提出一种两阶段管道对纸质心电图数字化，尤其在信号重叠时表现优异，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在解决纸基心电图记录数字化过程中，特别是处理被信号重叠破坏的单导联信号的挑战。现有的方法较少关注这个常见问题。

Method: 该论文中的方法包括一个两阶段管道。第一阶段使用训练过的U-Net分割网络来精准分割出主要的心电图信号。第二阶段借助已建立的数字化技术和自适应网格检测模块，将二进制的心电图信号转换为时间序列信号。

Result: 实验表明，U-Net能在细粒度分割任务中达到0.87的IoU，数字化方法在非重叠信号中实现了0.0010的MSE和0.9644的Pearson相关系数，在重叠信号中实现了0.0029的MSE和0.9641的相关系数，明显优于基线。

Conclusion: 该研究有效地提高了ECG电子化精度，特别是在信号重叠情况下，为电子化心电图数据的可靠转换提供了坚实基础，对现代研究和临床应用有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

Motivation: 当前在图信号处理中，节点数据的条件相关矩阵对图的拓扑结构起到关键作用，但随着节点数量增加，现有方法计算复杂度过高，难以处理高维数据。

Method: 提出了一种利用条件相关矩阵的低秩分解的图学习框架，并应用黎曼优化技术解决相应的优化问题。该方法在GLasso算法中实现为一种低秩约束版本，进行需求的图学习。

Result: 通过对合成和真实数据的实验，证明了该方法在处理维度和性能之间取得了很高效的平衡。

Conclusion: 本文提出的低秩分解方法及优化工具显著提高了图学习在大规模数据上的效率与效果。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

Motivation: MISL在下游任务的政策初始化方面缺乏理论支持，因此需要新的理论分析来增强技能的多样性和可分性，以提高下游任务的适应能力。

Method: 提出了一种新的解耦指标LSEPIN，并建立了信息几何与下游任务适应成本之间的联系。此外，探索了用Wasserstein距离替代信息几何中的KL散度的方法，并对其进行了几何分析，形成了新的技能学习目标WSEP。进一步，设计了基于Wasserstein距离的算法PWSEP，理论上能够发现全部最优初始策略。

Result: 结果表明，WSEP和PWSEP比MISL能够发现更多的初始策略，理论上提供了更好的下游任务适应能力。

Conclusion: 分析发现MISL在下游任务适应方面存在理论不足。提出了LSEPIN和WSEP来改善技能的多样性和可分离性，以增强下游任务的初始策略发现能力。研究表明，WSEP在下游任务适应中更具优势。

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数时间序列预测方法依赖于快速思维的模式，缺乏显式的中间推理过程。新兴的慢思维大型语言模型（LLMs）展现出优秀的多步推理能力，但仅靠提示工程存在诸多局限。

Method: 提出Time-R1框架，通过两阶段的强化微调，增强LLMs在时间序列预测中的多步推理能力。第一阶段进行监督微调以适应，第二阶段通过强化学习增强模型的泛化能力，并引入细粒度的多目标奖励及GRIP策略优化。

Result: 实验表明，Time-R1在不同数据集上的预测性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Time-R1通过增强LLMs的慢思考能力，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

Motivation: 通过重构Fisher信息度量来分析生成模型的潜在空间几何结构，包括统计物理模型和扩散模型。

Method: 该方法逼近给定生成样本的潜在变量的后验分布，并利用其学习对数分配函数，该函数定义了指数族的Fisher度量。

Result: 该方法在Ising和TASEP模型上验证，超过了现有基线，在重建热力学量方面表现更佳。在应用于扩散模型时，揭示了潜在空间中相变的分形结构，并展示了扩散模型在相边界处的潜在空间中Lipschitz常数的发散性。

Conclusion: 该研究为扩散模型潜在空间的复杂结构及其与相变现象的联系提供了新的见解。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: 研究分析了在数据分布变化下，思维链（CoT）对transformers处理困难问题的影响，发现CoT可能导致性能下降，并解释了原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的研究表明，在解决一些计算难题时，transformers受限于其表现力的绝对上限，而难以高效求解问题。然而，通过应用思维链（CoT），transformers能够有效解决一些难题，例如k-奇偶性问题。然而，这些工作依赖于两个假设：训练和测试分布相同，以及无污染的训练数据。而在现实世界中，这些假设并不总是成立。因此，本研究旨在深入探讨数据分布变化对模型性能的具体影响，特别是在k-奇偶性问题上。

Method: 本文通过研究分布偏移和数据中毒这两种数据变化类型，对应用CoT技术的模型在k-奇偶性问题上的表现进行了系统分析。

Result: 研究揭示了一个令人惊讶的现象：在学习奇偶性问题上，CoT方法的表现竟然比直接生成预测更差。此外，本研究提供了这种影响的机制原因的详细解释。

Conclusion: 虽然CoT在某些复杂问题上提高了transformers的表现，但当面对数据分布变化时，其性能可能不如传统方法高效。这引发了对CoT适用范围和实际应用条件的更多思考。

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

Motivation: 自组织映射（SOMs）在神经系统中具有可解释性和效率，但在面对连续任务时容易遭遇灾难性遗忘。

Method: 引入了一种名为饱和自组织映射（SatSOM）的SOMs扩展，通过一种新的饱和机制来逐渐减少神经元的学习率和邻域半径，让训练充分的神经元“冻结”，并将学习重定向到未充分利用的区域。

Result: SatSOM能够在持续学习场景中提高知识保留能力。

Conclusion: SatSOM通过引入饱和机制来有效应对SOMs在连续任务中灾难性遗忘的问题，实现了对知识更好的保存。

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

Motivation: 现代神经网络中通常会编码不需要的概念，导致公平性和可解释性的问题。现有方法在去除不需要的概念时往往会降低有用信号。

Method: SPLICE通过一种倾斜投影实现，能够去除不需要的方向，同时保护重要的标签相关性。

Result: SPLICE在Bias in Bios和Winobias等基准测试中表现优于基线，可以在最小化对主任务信息损害的前提下移除受保护的属性。

Conclusion: SPLICE提供了一种在消除神经网络中不需要概念的同时保持与目标标签协方差的方法，能够在保持主要任务信息的情况下去除受保护的属性。

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

Motivation: 目前的表格上下文学习架构虽然在表格数据结构上表现良好，但由于只在合成数据上进行训练，未能充分利用真实世界表格数据中的丰富语义和世界知识。相对的，以预训练大型语言模型为基础的表格上下文学习模型能够整合深度语义理解和世界知识，但由于架构上的限制，其能够利用的上下文量有限。本文旨在结合这两种方法的优点。

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于临床问答的神经网络方法，通过数据驱动的提示优化有效提高了性能，特别是在减少监督的情况下实现了精确的证据检索和答案生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)上的自动问答可以为临床医生和患者填补关键信息空白，但在有限的监督下，需要精确的证据检索和忠实的答案生成。

Method: 该方法将任务分为两个阶段：（1）句子级别的证据识别和（2）带有明确引用的答案合成。每个阶段使用DSPy's MIPROv2优化器自动探索提示空间，并在开发集上联合调整指令和少样本演示。通过自洽性投票方案提升证据召回率。

Result: 在隐藏测试集中，该方法获得了51.5的总分，在第二阶段赢得了比赛，并在标准零样本和少样本提示上分别超过了20和10分。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的提示优化可以作为模型微调的经济有效替代方法，提高高风险临床问答的可靠性。

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

Motivation: 传统数值天气预报技术虽有其效果，但在准确性和速度上逐渐无法与基于机器学习的天气模型相比。

Method: 本文介绍了一种被称为FGN的简单、可扩展且灵活的建模方法，通过学习模型扰动生成集合，该方法直接训练以最小化每个位置预报的连续等级概率评分（CRPS）。

Result: FGN在一系列确定性和概率性指标上的表现优于现有最先进的模型，能够有效预报热带气旋轨迹，抓住空间兼容结构。

Conclusion: FGN显著超越目前的最先进模型，在全球概率天气预报中提供了更准确的集合预报。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based weather models have rapidly risen to prominence
due to their greater accuracy and speed than traditional forecasts based on
numerical weather prediction (NWP), recently outperforming traditional
ensembles in global probabilistic weather forecasting. This paper presents FGN,
a simple, scalable and flexible modeling approach which significantly
outperforms the current state-of-the-art models. FGN generates ensembles via
learned model-perturbations with an ensemble of appropriately constrained
models. It is trained directly to minimize the continuous rank probability
score (CRPS) of per-location forecasts. It produces state-of-the-art ensemble
forecasts as measured by a range of deterministic and probabilistic metrics,
makes skillful ensemble tropical cyclone track predictions, and captures joint
spatial structure despite being trained only on marginals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索以较低的成本找到误差较小的单调分类器，并在误差允许超过最优分类器相对因子范围内取得成果。

Method: 通过对输入集P中点的标签揭示来测量算法成本，并采用上界和下界分析技术。

Result: 给出了在整个ε范围内几乎匹配的上界和下界结果，解决了以前只能通过绝对因子超过最优误差的问题。

Conclusion: 这篇文章首次研究了在单调分类中，以低于最优绝对值误差的最小代价来找到一个单调分类器的问题，提供了上界和下界。

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the LSR energy function for DenseAM networks, achieving exact memory retrieval with exponential capacity and introducing additional emergent local minima, surpassing traditional LSE-based models in creativity and storage capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve Dense Associative Memory networks by developing an energy function that allows for exact memory retrieval with exponential capacity without the need for exponential separation functions, while also introducing emergent local minima.

Method: The paper introduces a novel energy function called log-sum-ReLU (LSR) for Dense Associative Memory networks, inspired by kernel density estimation and based on the Epanechnikov kernel.

Result: Empirical results indicate that the LSR energy function generates significantly more local minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to those based on the traditional LSE function. It shows creativity and novelty in memory storage and generative tasks, as demonstrated with image datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed log-sum-ReLU (LSR) energy function for Dense Associative Memory networks offers significant advantages over the traditional log-sum-exponential (LSE) function. It enables exact memory retrieval with exponential capacity, introduces numerous additional emergent local minima, and maintains perfect pattern recovery. This suggests its potential for large-scale memory storage and generative tasks.

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

Method: 评估几种在合成数据上训练的探针架构，并进行实验以建立资源感知层级监控系统。在这些系统中，探针充当高效的初始过滤器，标记需要更昂贵的下游分析的案例。

Result: 探针在检测高风险互动方面的性能与中型LLM监控器相当，且提供六个数量级的计算节省。同时，实验表明探针可以作为高效的初始过滤器，帮助建立层级监控系统。

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

Result: 本文是关于DDLSs首个全面效率攻击分类学的系统性研究，揭示了现有防御机制中存在的不足。

Conclusion: 现有防御机制对日益流行的效率攻击有限，而未来自适应DDLSs需要新的缓解策略。

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

Motivation: 在增强学习中，如何在未知干扰下学习稳健地满足状态约束的策略仍然是一个亟待解决的问题。

Method: 研究文章通过分析两种在无模型增强学习中已经建立的技术——熵正则化和约束惩罚间的相互作用，提出一种新的稳健安全性实现视角。

Result: 通过实验证明，熵正则化在约束增强学习中本质上倾向于最大化未来可行操作的数量，从而促进对动作噪声的约束满足。此外，研究表明通过惩罚放宽严格的安全约束，可以将约束增强学习问题任意精确地近似为无约束问题，从而使用标准的无模型增强学习方法解决，同时保持安全性和最优性，并在实验证明下提升对干扰的抗性。

Conclusion: 熵正则化与稳健性之间的联系值得进一步的实证和理论研究，因为它通过简单的奖励塑造实现了增强学习中的稳健安全。

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新优化方法 NoLoCo，不需集体通信，较少通信开销，收敛速度比 DiLoCo 快 4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型的训练通常需要大规模算力集群，然而这样的集群扩展代价高昂且在一些场合变得不切实际，限制了可训练模型的规模。尽管一些最新方法减少了通信需求，但仍需同步模型参数，这在低带宽网络上会非常耗费成本。

Method: 在训练过程中，NoLoCo 通过不显式同步所有模型参数，并使用 Nesterov 动量优化器的新颖变体，通过与随机选择的其他模型部分平均模型权重，来隐式地同步模型权重。

Result: NoLoCo 方法在不同规模的模型和加速器数量下，通信开销显著减少，且同步步骤相比 DiLoCo 的 all-reduce 快一个数量级，无全局阻塞通信，减少了加速器空闲时间。结果表明，在相同模型规模和加速器数量下，其收敛速度比 DiLoCo 快达 4%。

Conclusion: NoLoCo 是一种新提出的优化方法，通过部分平均模型权重来隐式同步，而无需集体通信。与 DiLoCo 相比，NoLoCo 在各种模型规模和加速器数量下表现出更快的收敛速度。

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

Conclusion: CausalFM作为一个全面的框架，可以用于训练PFN基础模型，以适用于不同的因果推断情境，且表现具有竞争力。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Prefix-Scannable Models, which combine transformer expressivity with state space model efficiency, showing improved length generalization in tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find a class of neural sequence models that allow near-constant-time parallel evaluation and efficient sequential inference, unifying existing architectures and introducing new models.

Method: The paper defines Prefix-Scannable Models by relaxing the state aggregation operator, employing arbitrary functions like softmax attention, and evaluates these models on various tasks.

Result: The PSMs, by empirical evaluation, show both the expressivity of transformer-based architectures and the efficiency of state space models, surpassing them in length generalization in certain scenarios.

Conclusion: Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs) retain the expressivity of transformer architectures while matching the efficiency of state space models, sometimes even showing better length generalization.

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在高风险的招聘应用中被越来越多地使用，以做出直接影响人们职业和生活的决策。但在引入真实的上下文细节后，先前的反偏见提示无法有效消除人口统计偏见。

Method: 通过识别并中和模型激活中的敏感特征方向，实现内部偏见缓解，以在所有测试场景中实现稳健的偏见减少。

Result: 在各种主流商用模型和开源模型上，现实场景中的上下文引发了显著的种族和性别偏见。这些模型在通过细微的线索推断人口统计信息时可能变得有偏见，通过内部偏见缓解可以将偏见降低到很低的水平。

Conclusion: 在招聘使用的大型语言模型评估中应采用更现实的方法，并考虑使用内部缓解策略以实现公平结果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

TL;DR: 引入了自适应框架 SEAL，使 LLMs 能够通过自编辑机制进行权重更新和自适应，实验验证了其在知识整合和少样本泛化上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型强大，但它们缺乏适应新任务、知识或示例的能力。SEAL 的动机在于解决这一局限，使模型能够自适应。

Method: SEAL 利用生成微调数据和更新指令的方法，通过自编辑生成机制来对语言模型的权重进行更新。通过监督式微调，这些自编辑会导致持久的权重更新。使用强化学习循环，以更新后模型的下游表现作为奖励信号来训练模型生成有效的自编辑。

Result: 实验显示，SEAL 在知识整合和少样本泛化方面取得了良好的效果，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SEAL 提出了一个新的框架，使得大型语言模型可以通过生成自己的微调数据和更新指令来进行自适应。实验结果表明，SEAL 在知识整合和少样本泛化方面表现良好，展示了语言模型实现自我引导适应的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our
website and code is available at https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal.

TL;DR: 本文提出了GUARD框架，通过数据归因缓解大语言模型中的意外遗忘问题，显著提高保留信息的效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在执行数据遗忘任务时发生的意外遗忘问题，即在移除特定数据时无意中削弱了模型的效用和其对宝贵信息的保留。

Method: 提出了一种新的框架GUARD，通过数据识别来指导非均匀的忘记权重分配，减少了意外遗忘带来的影响。

Result: GUARD在进行10%训练数据的遗忘时，大大降低了保留集合的效用损失，效用牺牲减少高达194.92%。

Conclusion: GUARD在不损害忘记效果的前提下，显著提高了模型保留有用信息的能力，并对不同的LLM架构具有通用性。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

TL;DR: 引入执行信号以改进代码生成的EG-CFG方法，显著提升了生成性能，并在多种任务中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在代码生成方面表现出色，但在推理过程中通常不利用执行反馈，这是人类程序员常用的重要信号。本文旨在弥补这一缺陷，通过将实时执行信号融入语言模型生成过程，提高代码生成的准确性和可行性。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，称为Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG)，该方法在生成过程中动态地将执行信号融入模型，以逐行反馈引导代码生成。方法分为多阶段：首先通过束搜索为每行采样候选程序完成；其次，通过对这些候选程序进行测试提取执行信号；最后，在生成过程中将这些信号整合到提示中。

Result: 实验表明，EG-CFG在各种编码任务中显著提升了代码生成性能，与标准方法相比，达到了当前最先进的水平，无论是基础问题还是具有挑战性的竞赛编程任务。

Conclusion: EG-CFG方法通过结合执行信号为代码生成提供指导，显著提高了代码生成的性能，并能够在不同复杂度的任务中取得领先成绩。该方法支持任务级别的原生并行性，可探索多样的推理路径，生成广泛的候选解决方案集。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

*Aayush Karan,Kulin Shah,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGuidance improves sample realism and reward achievement for DPS in challenging inverse problems by inverting solutions for better initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free methods like DPS struggle with realism and reward achievement in hard inverse problems, especially those with low signal-to-noise ratios.

Method: ReGuidance wraps around existing algorithms by inverting solutions using the unconditional probability flow ODE, providing a better initialization for DPS.

Result: ReGuidance improves performance in large box in-painting and super-resolution tasks, providing better sample quality and reward.

Conclusion: ReGuidance significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency in hard inverse problems.

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Result: 发现当观察到足够数量的训练任务时，transformer可以达到在流形上进行Holder函数回归的极小极大率，并揭示了泛化误差与训练任务数量之间的关系。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了几何结构在上下文学习中的关键作用，并为研究非线性模型的上下文学习提供了新方法。

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

Motivation: 大规模语言模型（LLMs）的训练成本极高，导致小规模实验的见解难以转移到资源密集型生产系统中，从而阻碍了高效创新。

Method: 引入Farseer，一种新颖且经过改进的缩放法则，通过系统构建模型损失表面$L(N,D)$，提供增强的预测精度。

Result: Farseer实现了比先前法则（例如，Chinchilla's法则）更好的经验数据拟合，减少了433%的外推误差。

Conclusion: Farseer能够可靠地评估所有$(N,D)$设置下的竞争性训练策略，使得从小规模消融研究得出的结论可以自信地推断大型性能，并为现代LLM训练的优化计算分配提供新见解。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

Motivation: 在扩散桥或学习扩散系数时，LV损失不能像rKL损失那样通过数据处理不等式来进行动机化，因此需要探索替代方法。

Method: 采用rKL损失与对数导数技巧相结合的方法（rKL-LD）进行扩散桥采样器的训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用rKL-LD损失训练的扩散桥采样器在处理各类挑战性基准时表现更优。同时，rKL-LD损失训练稳定，超参数优化需求少。

Conclusion: rKL-LD损失在训练扩散桥采样器时，性能优于LV损失，并且需要更少的超参数优化。

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences
strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces
practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must
be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR
device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed
and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and
worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic
Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service
(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic
transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By
deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key
semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut
latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel
interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction
rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the
SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image
quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种融合多模态信号的3D面部动画生成方法，通过对比学习和基于注意力的扩散模型，提升了动画的情感相似性和动态表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决音频驱动的情感3D面部动画中的两个主要挑战：单模态控制信号的局限性和基于确定性回归的映射限制情感表现的多样性和合成动画的表现力。

Method: 使用FLAME为中心的多模态情感绑定策略，通过对比学习对齐文本、音频和情感标签等多种模态，实现灵活的情感控制。采用基于注意力的潜在扩散模型，具备内容感知注意力和情感引导层，增强动作多样性并保持时间一致性和自然的面部动态。

Result: 实验结果表明，相较于现有方法，该方法在大多数指标上表现更佳，实现了情感相似性21.6%的提升，同时保持面部动态的生理真实性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于扩散的框架来实现可控的富有表现力的3D面部动画，显著提升了情感相似性和面部动态的生理真实性。

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过分解叙事内容为多个层次并利用知识图谱捕捉语义、空间和时间关系，以实现对视觉叙事的结构化理解，特别是漫画这样的多模态媒体。

Method: 构建层次化知识图谱框架，通过多模态图链接视觉元素与文本元素，并整合跨越叙事层面的知识图谱，以支持对故事结构、角色连续性和事件进展的推理。

Conclusion: 该工作为视觉媒体中的叙事内容分析、多模态推理及互动故事讲述提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用波列分析的多模态意图识别框架，在非语言信息处理中取得了显著成绩，达到新的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本分析上优先，但往往忽视了非语言线索中丰富的语义内容。为了更好地理解意图，该研究通过频域分析来增强非语言信息的处理。

Method: 论文提出了一个波列驱动的多模态意图识别框架（WDMIR），其中包括一个波列驱动融合模块和一个跨模态交互机制，用于在频域中分析和融合视频和音频特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在意图识别上达到了最优性能，并且消融研究表明波列驱动融合模块在非语言信息语义提取上显著提高。

Conclusion: 提出的波​​列驱动多模态意图识别框架（WDMIR）在MIntRec数据集上的性能达到了当前最优表现，准确率提高了1.13%。

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal
systems.

*Von Ralph Dane Marquez Herbuela,Yukie Nagai*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了语音与面部、手部动作的多模态情感连接，发现非重叠讲话增强了面部情感表达的活跃性，而低唤醒和重叠讲话增强了手语同步性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深入理解情感在真实互动中的表达关键在于语音与区域面部和手部动作的动态链接，这对人类互动和AI系统中的实时情感检测尤为重要。

Method: 该研究使用来自IEMOCAP语料库双向互动中的区域特定动作捕获技术，分析语音特征与3D面部及手部标记位移的关系。语音特征包括低级语调、MFCCs，以及模型推导的唤醒度、效价、及分类情感（快乐、悲伤、愤怒、中性）。通过帧位移幅度量化表达活跃性，并通过语音特征与面部及手部动作的预测进行映射。

Result: 非重叠语音引起面部下半部和嘴巴区域更活跃的情感表达，悲伤在非重叠时表现更强烈，而愤怒在重叠时减弱手势表现。语调及MFCCs在发声相关区域具有最高预测准确度，而唤醒度和效价表现出更低且更具上下文敏感性的相关性。手语同步在低唤醒及重叠讲话时有所增强，但效价无影响。

Conclusion: 语言与面部及手部动作的多模态同步显著影响情感表达的清晰度和检测的准确性。研究指出在非重叠讲话时，情绪的表达更加活跃，尤其是在面部下半部分。不同情绪在面对面和重叠讲话时表现出不同的表达方式。

Abstract: Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and
gestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader
dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand
motion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and
behavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the
coordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn
taking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and
simultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this
alignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances
realtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony
across modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study
examines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from
dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level
prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions
(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker
displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise
displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech
features to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently
elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness
showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed
gestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for
prosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower
and more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was
enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种具有时空旋转等变性的深度解卷网络（DUN-SRE），通过综合利用时空对称性提升动态MRI重建图像质量，尤其是在心脏CINE MRI中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态MRI重建模型未能有效利用时空对称性，特别是时间上的对称性，这限制了重建图像的质量。为了改进这一点，有必要开发一种新的模型来更好地利用这些对称性提高图像重建质量。

Method: 提出了一种新的深度解卷积网络（DUN-SRE），采用（2+1）D等变卷积结构，在重建过程中保持时空旋转对称性，结合数据一致性和近端映射模块，确保心脏动态影像的物理准确建模。同时开发了一种高保真组滤波器参数化机制，以在强制对称约束的情况下保持表示精度。

Result: 在心脏CINE MRI数据集上的实验表明，DUN-SRE在保持旋转对称结构方面达到了最先进的性能，展示了在广泛的动态MRI重建任务中的强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过在动态MRI重建中引入时空旋转对称性，DUN-SRE有效提高了图像质量，特别是在保留旋转对称结构方面，证明其在各种动态MRI任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于对颅内出血（ICH）的标注过程繁琐且费用高昂，本文研发了一种能够在标注数据稀缺的情况下进行有效分割的方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为SWDL-Net的半监督学习框架，通过拉普拉斯金字塔和深度卷积上采样的互补优势来实现病灶细节和边界的优越分割。

Result: SWDL-Net在仅有2%标注数据的情况下，在271个ICH数据集上和公共基准测试中均优于现有的最新方法。在脑出血分割数据集（BHSD）上使用5%标注数据的额外评估进一步证明了其优势。

Conclusion: SWDL-Net能够在极少标注数据的情况下优于现有方法，对医学图像中的病灶细节和边界提供了高效的分割能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been
released at https://github.com/SIAT-CT-LAB/SWDL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种SNR和计算自适应的分布式CNN框架，通过学习辅助遗传算法优化配置，在低SNR和有限计算资源下显著提高了图像分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备的传感器基于本地推断面临严重的计算限制，通常需要通过嘈杂的无线信道传输数据以进行服务器端处理。为解决此问题，使用基于分割网络的深度神经网络（DNN）联合信源信道编码（JSCC）方案来提取和传输相关特征而非原始数据。然而，现有大多数方法依赖于固定的网络拆分和静态配置，缺乏对不同计算预算和信道条件的适应性。

Method: 引入了一种学习辅助智能遗传算法（LAIGA），通过有效探索CNN超参数空间，在给定的FLOPs约束和SNR下优化网络配置。LAIGA利用随机森林的学习辅助，避免全面探索超参数空间，并在候选最佳配置中引入应用特定偏向。

Conclusion: 提出的SNR-和计算自适应分布式CNN框架在低SNR和有限计算资源下的性能优于固定拆分架构和现有的SNR自适应方法，特别是在SNR低至-10dB时，在各种计算预算下实现了10%的分类精度提升。

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational
limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for
server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network
(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and
transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods
rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to
varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless
image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a
learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently
explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under
given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the
infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT
device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to
avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application
specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures
and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited
computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy
as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR
as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M
FLOPs) at IoT device.

Abstract: Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or
phrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been
dedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines
of research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case
scenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as
there has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,
we bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on
keyphrase generation, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress,
limitations, and open challenges. Our findings highlight several critical
issues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among
commonly-used benchmark datasets and inconsistencies in metric calculations
leading to overestimated performances. Additionally, we address the limited
availability of pre-trained models by releasing a strong PLM-based model for
keyphrase generation as an effort to facilitate future research.

capacities of instruction following, content generation, and reasoning, attract
significant attention and advancements, providing new opportunities and
challenges for building up intelligent conversational search systems. This

topics revolutionized by LLMs in the context of conversational search. It is
designed for students, researchers, and practitioners from both academia and
industry. Participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of both the core
principles and cutting-edge developments driven by LLMs in conversational

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR)
systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be
challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well
retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.
Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to
generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs
to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous
work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have
the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is
needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the
reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs
are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we
examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are
used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in
evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.
We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects
model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation
results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for
e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as
significant in comparing relative system performance. Codes and data are

Motivation: 现有基于GNN的方法对噪声或无关边缘高度敏感，且容易过拟合，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 首先为每个互动提取局部邻域子图，然后生成两个不同的图表示。第一个图表示通过结合GNN层与注意力机制来强调去噪，第二个通过图变分自编码器对齐特征分布与标准先验。使用互学习损失函数来协调这些表示。

Conclusion: MCCL方法能够显著提高矩阵补全任务中评分预测的准确性和排名效果。

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as
predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a
comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural
network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant
edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to
overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning
(MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each
interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The
first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an
attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational
autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A
mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually
harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns
and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on
several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the
numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement
in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in
ranking metrics.

*Yanhui Li,Dongxia Wang,Zhu Sun,Haonan Zhang,Huizhong Guo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了LightKG，一种简化的图神经网络知识图谱推荐系统，在稀疏和密集场景中表现优异，较其他系统提高了推荐准确率并减少了训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂的GNN模型在稀疏交互场景中往往表现更差，而注意机制等复杂机制可能会增加学习的难度。

Method: LightKG包括一个简化的GNN层，将有向关系编码为标量对而不是密集嵌入，并采用线性聚合框架，大大减少了GNN的复杂性。此外，LightKG引入了一个高效的对比层来实施自监督学习，直接最大化原始图中的节点相似性，避开了之前自监督学习方法中耗时的子图生成和比较。

Result: LightKG在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，无论是在稀疏还是密集场景中，它在推荐准确度上均超越了12个竞争性KGRS，同时显著减少了训练时间。

Conclusion: LightKG不仅在稀疏场景，还在密集场景中，均超过12种竞技型知识图谱推荐系统，同时显著减少训练时间。具体来说，它在推荐准确率上平均超越最佳基准5.8%，并相比于具有自监督学习的知识图谱推荐系统节省84.3%的训练时间。

Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for
Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven
effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training
time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to
other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior
performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models
tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,
like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning
difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet
powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a
simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather
than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly
reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an
efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node
similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation
and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and
dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it
surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy
and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LTV prediction for digital games by addressing issues like delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and high-value outliers, which existing models struggle with.

Method: SHORE integrates short-horizon predictions as auxiliary tasks and introduces a hybrid loss function combining order-preserving multi-class classification with dynamic Huber loss.

Result: SHORE achieved a 47.91% relative reduction in prediction error in online experiments, showing better performance than existing models.

Conclusion: SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines with a 47.91% relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment, proving its effectiveness and robustness for industrial-scale LTV prediction in digital games.

Abstract: In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is
essential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to
delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of
high-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle
observations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often
underestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these
issues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression
(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon
predictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle
targets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining
order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to
mitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.
Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\%
relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment. These results
highlight SHORE's practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale
LTV prediction for digital games.

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant
challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs.
Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures,
relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding
graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In
this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first
approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific
macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts.
Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the
first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information
effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate
macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering
multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender
system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark
datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning
methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based
recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE
in billion-scale recommender systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting
strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high
effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for
larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior
efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores
for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical
comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of
pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key
innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise
Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between
each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.
We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of
pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by
capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive
relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise
methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a
training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR
benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous
pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also
achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require
substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the
efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

Motivation: 研究高维简单形在存在噪声条件下的学习问题，推导出信息论下界，解决之前未解问题。

Method: 我们利用样本压缩技术及引入了一个新的基于傅里叶的方法来从噪声观测中恢复分布，可应用于简单形学习之外的场景。

Result: 证明存在一种算法，在给定的样本复杂度下可以以高概率输出与真实简单形在某距离上的误差不超过ε的结果，并推导出信息论下界。在噪声情景复杂度和无噪声情景复杂度达到一致。

Conclusion: 本文解决了一个未解问题，即在当信噪比SNR大于等于Ω(K^1/2)时，噪声情况下的样本复杂度与无噪声情况下相一致。

Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning
high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we
consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance.
We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex
within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the
true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2)
e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new
information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV
distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3
\sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the
noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge
\Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We
resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge
\Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our
analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and
introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy
observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.

Conclusion: 3MSBM在捕获具有时间依赖的复杂动态方面表现优于现有方法，并为多边距环境下的匹配框架训练开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample
snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g.,
single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge
and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise
interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture
long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the
inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum
Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching
framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that
satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the
dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned
on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal
control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a
variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal
conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that
preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving
convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of
real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to
existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies,
opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal
settings.

Conclusion: 本文探讨了在对抗到随机的在线学习环境中，如何通过对分布限制的对抗者进行学习。在某些情况下，即使没有分布类的先验知识，仍然可以实现学习。

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

Result: 在一维高斯混合模型和DDPM模型（CIFAR10数据集训练）上验证了方法，发现语义信息传递在扩散中间阶段最高，最终阶段消失。不同类别的熵率曲线有显著差异。

Conclusion: 语义信息传递在扩散的中间阶段达到最高，在最终阶段几乎消失。不同类别的熵率曲线存在明显差异，不同的“语义决策”位于不同的中间时间。

Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated
images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a
phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and
other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic
approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the
generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian
classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the
noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest
information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time
derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on
one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the
CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is
highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the
final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate
profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions"
are located at different intermediate times.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的Box-Constrained Softmax函数以执行输出概率的硬性约束，并开发了相应的计算方法以提高模型的可靠性，并在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现代机器学习中，控制软最大值模型的输出概率是一个常见问题。虽然Softmax函数通过其温度参数提供软控制，但缺乏实施硬约束（如输出概率的区间约束）的能力，这在某些需要可靠且可信模型的应用中是关键的。

Method: 提出了一种新的函数Box-Constrained Softmax（BCSoftmax），作为Softmax函数的广义形式，用于明确地对输出概率设置下限和上限。另外，开发了一种精确且高效的计算BCSoftmax的方法。

Result: 实验使用TinyImageNet、CIFAR-100和20NewsGroups数据集，表明该方法在校准指标上实现了改进。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过学习输出概率或logits的上下界来缓解预测模型中的不置信和过度置信，从而增强下游决策任务的可靠性。

Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common
problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function
provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to
enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities,
which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and
trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax
($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on
output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution
to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient
computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we
introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The
proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive
models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or
logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream
decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods
experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets,
achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

TL;DR: The study extends PAC-Bayesian learning to adaptive off-policy settings, enhancing data collection and achieving superior performance over static methods, particularly with intermediate policy deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable more practical and flexible off-policy learning by iteratively refining policies and collecting higher-quality data, surpassing the limitations of static behavior policy frameworks.

Method: Extending the PAC-Bayesian learning framework with Logarithmic Smoothing to the adaptive scenario, utilizing online PAC-Bayesian theory, and adjusting the LS estimator for multiple deployment rounds.

Result: The method achieves faster convergence rates and improved performance compared to leading offline approaches, especially when intermediate policy deployments are integrated. Its effectiveness is confirmed through empirical evaluations across various scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in adaptive off-policy learning by allowing for intermediate policy deployments, significantly outperforming existing offline methods.

Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal
policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In
this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive
off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to
collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning
with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to
the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally
accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates
under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline
approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when
intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across
diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and
the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

Conclusion: 新提出的估计器在方差减少方面优于标准方法，特别是在测试系统相似时效果显著。

Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating
the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a
baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each
exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the
difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the
commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.
We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower
variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the
estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and
offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit
similarities. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

Motivation: 在隐藏混杂因素存在的情况下，因果效应估计是一个复杂的问题，因此希望通过非参数化工具变量回归来解决这个问题。

Method: 采用非参数工具变量回归，并使用通过谱特征进行的两阶段最小二乘估计。

Result: 研究发现方法的性能取决于谱特征的对齐程度和特征值的衰减情况，通过合成实验验证了不同情况下的结果分类。其中强对齐和慢衰减时效果最佳，而弱对齐时则可能失败。

Conclusion: 在良好情况下，方法具有最佳表现，而在糟糕情况下，则需要更多样本来学习特征。最后，如果对齐非常弱，方法可能无法成功。

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We
derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator
based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and
failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to
a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This
occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is
well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled
with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument.
Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but
rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly
more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario,
weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the
eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate
this taxonomy.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is often costly, requiring either
extensive human annotation or expensive experiments. We propose a method that
supplements such "expert" labels with AI predictions from pre-trained models to

### [211] [What Exactly Does Guidance Do in Masked Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10971)
*He Ye,Rojas Kevin,Tao Molei*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 研究了带无分类器指导的掩码离散扩散模型，推导出指导影响采样行为的显式解，指导可放大特定类区域，影响采样分布的协方差结构，实验验证了理论分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究的动机是探索如何通过无分类器指导的手段影响掩码离散扩散模型的采样行为，从而实现从特定类别进行采样的目标。

Method: 本文通过假设没有得分误差或离散化误差，推导出引导反向动态的显式解决方案，从而精确刻画指导如何影响采样行为。研究不仅依赖理论分析，还通过实验示例支持了其理论结论。

Result: 研究结果表明，当数据分布是类别的混合物时，通过指导可以放大类别特定区域，同时抑制与其他类别共享的区域。该效果依赖于指导强度，并在采样分布中引发独特的协方差结构。此外，不同维度（1D和2D）中呈现出定量不同的行为，并且当指导强度增大时，反向动态过程中的总变差衰减速率在两个维度上都是双指数级。

Conclusion: 本文结论是，指导过程不仅在塑造输出分布中发挥重要作用，还能控制采样轨迹的动态。理论分析得到实验支持，实验展示了指导的几何效应及其对收敛性的影响。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit
solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the
sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data
distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a
specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses
regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength
$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.
Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We
also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation
($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for
both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in
shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the
sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that
illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.

### [212] [Encoding call-by-push-value in the pi-calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10584)
*Benjamin Bennetzen,Nikolaj Rossander Kristensen,Peter Buus Steffensen*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: 本文定义并验证了CBPV到π-演算的编码，以及该编码符合某些标准和存在与其他编码的相似性，部分Coq验证尚未完成，但被认为合理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在证明Levy的按推值调用语言（CBPV）可以被正确和完整地编码到π-演算中，同时还希望该编码符合优秀编码标准，并与现有编码方法（如Milner的编码）进行比较。

Method: 采用了一种非正式（手工）的证明方法，展示了编码的健全性、完备性以及所有必要的引理。编码被专门化为内部π-演算（pi-i-calculus）以绕过形式化过程中使用de Bruijn索引的某些挑战，同时通过早期、后期和开放式的双重模拟在此设置中一致，而双重模拟也是一个全等关系。此外，研究对健全性和完备性证明开始了Coq形式化，但并未完全形式化所有引理。

Result: 研究成功定义并验证了CBPV到π-演算的编码，其符合Gorla的编码标准并与Milner的编码存在相似性。同时还进行了部分Coq形式化验证，尽管未全部完成，但所未证明的引理被认为是合理的。

Conclusion: 本文成功定义了Levy的按推值调用语言（CBPV）到π-演算的编码，并证明了该编码的正确性和完备性。研究还验证了该编码符合Gorla提出的优良编码五个标准，并与Milner的编码存在相似性。

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: StepProof通过细粒度逐步验证改进了前人的自动形式化方法，提高了验证成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动形式化方法缺乏细粒度的句子级验证能力。

Method: 提出StepProof，一种面向细化的逐步验证的自动形式化方法。

Result: 通过StepProof，验证的成功率和效率相比传统方法明显提高。手动调整自然语言证明以适应步骤级验证进一步提高了性能。

Conclusion: StepProof显著提升了成功率和效率。

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal
verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their
lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of
natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of
translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified.
Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited
to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level
verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel
autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification.
StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs,
enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that
StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to
the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification,
further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

*Yuke Xie,Hervé Chauris,Nicolas Desassis*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种整合去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）到全波形反演（FWI）中的新框架，提高了地震成像的稳定性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统求解方法需要进行完整的反向扩散过程，并在噪声中间状态下操作，这在物理约束的计算地震成像中存在挑战，尤其是在全波形反演（FWI）等非线性求解器中，这会导致数值伪影和质量下降。

Method: 该方法通过分数重匹配策略，将预训练的去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）作为生成扩散先验，直接集成到全波形反演（FWI）中。与传统扩散方法不同，该方法避免了反向扩散采样，操作完全在干净的图像空间中进行，并通过简单将生成扩散先验作为标准FWI更新规则中的正则化项。

Result: 数值实验证实，该方法在反演质量和鲁棒性方面优于传统方法和GAN-based方法，同时在计算效率上具有实际可操作性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的方法，将预训练的去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）作为生成扩散先验，集成到全波形反演（FWI）中，以改善反演质量。实验结果显示，该方法在保真度和鲁棒性方面优于传统和基于GAN的FWI方法，同时保持实用性和计算效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors
for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the
full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,
which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.
In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those
used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy
velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates
a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based
generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike
traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion
sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in
the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity
models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple
regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal
modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation
and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical
experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and
robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while
remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other
inverse problem tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出方法用于根据电波数据自动分类散射信号，结果分类模型被训练出多种类别，并初步进行了物理解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是开发一种根据电波数据自动构建分类器的方法，为了更好地理解电波散射信号模型及其不同类别的特性。

Method: 该研究采用基于雷达观测数据、无线电波传播模型及质量评估数学准则的方法，通过12个雷达的数据进行模型训练，分类模型基于计算的无线电波在模型电离层中的传播参数与雷达实际测量参数。

Result: 研究发现数据中有37个最佳分类，其中25个常见，同时选择了14个类别进行自信分类和解释。此外，观察不同类别的动态及其与地理纬度和日地活动水平的关系不矛盾于已知的物理机制。

Conclusion: 结合多个雷达的数据，该研究通过模型自动分类散射信号并初步解释了其中多个类别的物理机制，所使用的方法不违背已知的物理机制。

Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for
processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based
only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio
wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating
the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data
obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for
each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the
classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave
propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the
radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made
using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal
number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The
analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently
separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of
10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and
their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of
solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not
contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most
important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal
ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and
the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

TL;DR: 该研究通过将大语言模型集成到软件开发工作流程中，实现自动化代码问题检测与修复，显著提高了代码质量并简化了开发过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高软件开发流程，特别是提高代码质量、简化开发过程并减少时间和资源消耗，论文旨在通过将大语言模型（LLMs），如OpenAI的GPT-3.5 Turbo和GPT-4o，集成到软件开发工作流程中，实现代码问题检测与修订的自动化。

Method: 在一个静态代码分析框架下，检测大规模软件项目中的问题，如错误、安全漏洞和代码异味。每个问题的详细信息被提取并组织，以利于使用LLMs进行自动化代码修订。通过迭代的提示工程过程，确保提示被结构化以生成与项目要求一致且准确有序的输出。实现检索增强生成（RAG），以提高修订的相关性和精确度，使LLM能够访问和整合实时外部知识。构建了自定义的“代码比较应用”，在应用到代码库之前识别和纠正错误改变，以解决LLM幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 结合大语言模型、静态代码分析和检索增强生成可提高代码质量，并精简软件开发过程。

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted
and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative
prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to
produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance
and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time
external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates
plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code
Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis
framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code
quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and
resource expenditure.

Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLM）生成代码的质量对输入的变化敏感，尤其是对用户的背景和软件开发熟悉程度，因此需要量化LLM的这种敏感度。

Method: 主张一种用于生成代码的合成评估管道和系统的基于个性化的评估方法，用来揭示LLM响应中依赖于潜在用户背景的质量差异。这些方法不依赖于特定的编程任务和LLM，因此具备广泛应用的潜力。

Conclusion: 本研究综合评估了大型语言模型（LLM）在代码生成中的响应变化。在合成评估管道和基于个性化的系统评估方法下，LLM对用户背景敏感性进行了有效量化。实验结果表明这些方法的实用性，并开放代码以供社区使用。

Abstract: Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and
accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs
depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and
quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity
with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's
sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic
evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic
persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM
responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are
completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are
widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our
methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BugGen利用LLMs生成和验证功能bug，显著增强验证效率和机器学习调试，产生了高质量的bug数据集，并比手动插入效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件复杂性不断增加，对验证资源造成压力，促使人们采用机器学习方法来提高调试效率。然而，机器学习辅助调试关键依赖于多样化和可扩展的bug数据集，而现有的手动或自动bug插入方法无法可靠地产生这样的数据集。

Method: BugGen是一种完全自主的多代理管道，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）系统地生成、插入和验证RTL中的现实功能bug。它对模块进行分区，通过一个闭环代理架构选择变异目标，并采用迭代优化和回滚机制，以确保语法正确性和功能可检测性。

Result: BugGen在五个OpenTitan IP模块上进行评估，产生了500个独特bug，功能准确率达94%，每小时验证bug吞吐量达到17.7个，比典型的手动专家插入快五倍。此外，BugGen在OpenTitan回归测试中识别出104个此前未检测到的bug。在与Certitude的比较中，BugGen的语法准确率高出两倍，测试盲点的暴露更深入，提供更具功能意义和复杂性的bug场景。此外，使用这些BugGen生成的数据集训练的基于ML的故障分类模型在不同IP模块上实现了高分类准确率（88.1%-93.2%），确认了生成的bug的实用性和真实性。

Conclusion: BugGen提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，用于生成高质量的bug数据集，显著提高了验证效率和机器学习辅助调试。

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating
the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency.
However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug
datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to
reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous,
multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically
generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen
partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic
architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to
ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across
five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional
accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five
times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen
identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,
highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared
against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,
deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and
complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were
employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high
classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming
the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a
scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly
enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

Motivation: 由于用户反馈量大，用户对AI功能的感知、评价和批评难以探索，因此我们进行全面的大规模用户反馈研究。

Method: 我们开发并验证了一种多阶段分析管道，始于人工标记基准，并系统性地评估大型语言模型（LLMs）和提示策略，包括评审分类、方面-情感提取和聚类。

Result: 分析中提取了一百多万个方面-情感对，聚类为18个正面和15个负面用户主题。

Conclusion: 我们的分析表明，用户反馈集中在一些特定主题上：正面评论强调生产力、可靠性和个性化帮助，而负面反馈强调技术故障、价格问题以及语言支持的局限性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The process of creating large-scale datasets for GitHub issue resolution is challenging and labor-intensive, motivating the need for an automated solution to streamline the process.

Method: The SWE-Factory pipeline includes three core automated components: SWE-Builder for environment construction, exit-code-based grading to replace manual grading, and automated fail2pass validation using exit codes.

Result: The automated pipeline successfully constructs valid task instances, with significant cost reductions and high accuracy in grading and validation processes.

Conclusion: SWE-Factory provides an effective automated pipeline for constructing large-scale, high-quality datasets for GitHub issue resolution, reducing labor-intensive efforts and costs.

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at
https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管SSH模型是一个经典的1D拓扑绝缘体模型，但其在复杂条件下的行为仍具有研究价值。研究动机在于探索SSH模型在类周期性无序、非厄米性和时间依赖驱动条件下的拓扑性质和局域化特性。

Method: 使用了精确对角化和专门的数值求解器进行计算，并采用无监督机器学习（主成分分析）对系统相位进行分类。此外，还应用了周期Floquet驱动来探索不同系统状态。

Result: 研究发现，标准SSH模型中的拓扑边界态会由于强Aubry-André-Harper（AAH）调制导致的局域化转变而被破坏。还发现了非厄米皮肤效应，以及通过周期Floquet驱动，在拓扑上平凡的链中成功创建了具有异常边界态的Floquet拓扑绝缘体。

Conclusion: 本文通过计算研究拓展的SSH模型，揭示了其在类周期性无序、非厄米性和时间依赖驱动等条件下的行为，总结了非厄米皮肤效应和Floquet拓扑绝缘体的形成，表明强局域化可能掩盖底层拓扑特征。

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a
one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex,
realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents
a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models,
exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder,
non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and
specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its
spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse
Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model
exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a
localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to
autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization
can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond
Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization
of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to
a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological
insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the
boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a
multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological
systems.

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了在固态电解质界面层（SEI）中形成的一种新的晶体无序相Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$，并解释了实验观察到的SEI形成和锂蠕变机制。这强调了对完整反应和传输动力学进行显式建模的重要性。

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the
formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the
viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit
reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell,
{\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network
interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and
interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised
classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic
environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported
crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the
SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics,
underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport
kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of
the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite
initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our
approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable
parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain
insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in
solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

*Abiodun Ganiyu,Pranshav Gajjar,Vijay K Shah*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: AI5GTest 是一个人工智能驱动的测试框架，旨在自动化验证 O-RAN 组件，减少了测试时间且确保高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN 的分离架构导致在验证多厂商组件时面临复杂的测试挑战，现有框架如 OTICs 依赖手动过程，易出现错误和扩展性问题。

Method: AI5GTest 利用一个合作的大型语言模型 (LLM) 框架，其中包括 Gen-LLM、Val-LLM 和 Debug-LLM，分别用于生成测试案例流程、验证信令消息并进行根本原因分析。此外，AI5GTest 还融入了"人在环中"机制，以在验证前让测试者批准规范。

Result: 通过一系列从 O-RAN TIFG 和 WG5-IOT 测试规范中获得的测试案例进行评估，AI5GTest 显示出显著缩短测试时间，并保持高准确性。

Conclusion: AI5GTest 显著减少了与传统手动方法相比的总体测试执行时间，同时保持了高验证精度。

Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the
telecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,
and rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces
complex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components
against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as
those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on
manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to
inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present
AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to
automate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative
Large Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and
Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test
cases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references
signaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect
deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,
providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and
trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for
approval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test
cases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest
demonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to
traditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.

Motivation: 为了实现精确、计算高效且可在现实中部署的流量分类算法，特别是在广泛应用于基于物联网的智能系统和通信网络中的资源有限的微控制器上。

Method: 本文通过开发一个轻量级的1D卷积神经网络（1D-CNN），并利用硬件感知神经架构搜索（HW-NAS）进行优化。模型在量化为INT8时，精度仅下降1-2%。

Result: 模型在ISCX VPN-NonVPN数据集上达到了96.59%的准确率，通用性良好。实际部署在STM32F746G-DISCO和Nucleo-F401RE微控制器上，推理延迟分别为31.43ms和115.40ms，能耗分别为7.86 mJ和29.10 mJ。

Conclusion: 本文成功开发了一个轻量级的1D-CNN，通过硬件感知神经架构搜索（HW-NAS）进行了优化，能够在资源有限的微控制器上实现能效高的流量分类，并在不同的流量分类任务中表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical deep learning (DL) approach for
energy-efficient traffic classification (TC) on resource-limited
microcontrollers, which are widely used in IoT-based smart systems and
communication networks. Our objective is to balance accuracy, computational
efficiency, and real-world deployability. To that end, we develop a lightweight
1D-CNN, optimized via hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), which
achieves 96.59% accuracy on the ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset with only 88.26K
parameters, a 20.12K maximum tensor size, and 10.08M floating-point operations
(FLOPs). Moreover, it generalizes across various TC tasks, with accuracies
ranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8,
suffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32
counterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two
microcontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive
Nucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and
115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference,
respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of on-device encrypted
traffic analysis, paving the way for scalable, low-power IoT security
solutions.

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its
decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We
propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent
years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from
sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these
methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the
Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1)
classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and
(2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we
design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution
generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification
task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval
task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive
Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task
and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 本文通过学习随机几何图变量提出了三种识别蛋白质关键残基的方法，并证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别蛋白质的关键残基是科研的重点，因为这些残基对蛋白质功能至关重要。

Method: 我们提出通过学习随机几何图（RGG）变量的方法来识别蛋白质的关键残基，其中每个残基的状态变量与图的节点相连，并使用每对残基的状态变量之间的相关性矩阵学习RGG。

Result: 我们对三种不同的关键性参数化进行了比较，结果与通过实验确定的关键残基相一致。

Conclusion: 通过学习随机几何图的创新方法，我们成功识别并验证了蛋白质的关键残基。

Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since
such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of
recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is
tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning
a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of
156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using
the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given
the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue
pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn
an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when
parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we
develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the
posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues,
and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation
of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the
protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained
with the three distinct criticality parameters, against
experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

Conclusion: SPARKE方法有效地在大规模生成环境中提供多样性指导，提高了生成数据的多样性，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

Conclusion: ScoreMix方法有效提高了在标签数据有限的情况下判别模型的性能，尤其是通过生成挑战性较大的合成样本来增强模型的判别能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别面临同时处理模态丢失和分布外数据（OOD）的问题；现有方法依赖特定模型或引入过多参数，限制其实用性。

Method: 提出了因果推理蒸馏器（CIDer）框架，并引入随机模态特征丢失（RMFM）任务。CIDer包含两个关键模块：模型特定的自蒸馏模块（MSSD）和模型无关的因果推理模块（MACI）。MSSD通过权重共享的自蒸馏方法，提高在RMFM任务下的鲁棒性；MACI使用定制因果图处理分布外数据中的标签和语言偏差。

Conclusion: CIDer框架有效解决了多模态情感识别中的模态丢失和分布外数据问题，具有鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

Motivation: DL模型在自动化皮肤癌分类方面显示出潜力，但其性能受限于数据稀缺性和缺乏不确定性意识，因此需进行改进。

Method: 使用转移学习和不确定性量化（UQ）对HAM10000数据集中的DL模型进行全面评估，并使用多种方法来量化模型的不确定性。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了在DL模型中整合UQ能够提高皮肤癌诊断的准确性和可信性。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

Conclusion: VideoDeepResearch展示了在LVU任务中超越现有MLLM基准的显著提升，表明了具有代理能力的系统在解决关键挑战方面的潜力。

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and

*Sadia Kamal,Tim Oates,Joy Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种生成临床SOAP笔记的弱监督多模态框架，减少了手动注释的负担，并引入新的评估指标来评估临床质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医生手动生成SOAP笔记的过程繁重导致临床医生倦怠，需要一种方法减少人工注释并生成临床文档。

Method: 采用弱监督多模态框架，利用有限的输入，包括病变图像和稀疏临床文本，生成SOAP笔记。

Result: 提出的方法在关键临床相关性指标上的性能可以与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro媲美，并引入了两个新的评估指标来评估临床质量。

Conclusion: 提出了一种弱监督多模态框架，能够通过有限的输入生成临床结构化的SOAP笔记，从而减少手动注释的需求，并缓解临床医生的负担。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

### [238] [Using Vision Language Models to Detect Students' Academic Emotion through Facial Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10334)
*Deliang Wang,Chao Yang,Gaowei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究利用视觉语言模型分析学生在线学习的表情情绪，Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct表现优于Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct，在识别困惑表情方面更具潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的监督学习算法在分析学生学术情绪方面存在泛化问题，需要重复的数据收集、标注和训练。新兴的视觉语言模型（VLMs）提供了一种通过零样本提示进行视觉识别任务泛化的新方法。

Method: 研究使用两个VLMs，Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct和Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct，通过零样本提示来分析5,000张图像中学生的面部表情，包括困惑、分心、快乐、中立和疲惫。

Result: 初步结果显示，Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct在学术面部表情识别中表现优于Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct，特别是在识别困惑表情时表现突出。

Conclusion: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct模型有潜力用于识别导致学生困惑的内容，而两个模型均能很好地识别快乐情绪，但对分心行为的识别较弱。

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出一种新的多模态框架，通过视觉-语言模型分析城市街景风格差异，构建了包含建筑图像的数据集UrbanDiffBench，并开发了分析框架UrbanSense。实验表明该方法有能力量化和解释城市风格演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的城市文化研究方法往往依赖于专家解读和历史文献，这在不同背景下难以标准化。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种基于视觉-语言模型的多模态研究框架，旨在自动化和可扩展地分析城市街景风格差异。

Method: 本文通过构建一个名为UrbanDiffBench的精选数据集，包含不同时期和地区的建筑图像，同时开发了UrbanSense，这是一个基于视觉-语言模型的框架，用于城市街景分析，使城市风格表征的生成和比较具有定量能力。实验结果表明，超过80%的生成描述通过了t检验，而主观评价中的Phi分数也很高。

Result: 实验结果显示，超过80%的生成描述通过了t检验（p<0.05）。主观评价中的Phi得分显示，该方法能够捕捉微妙的风格差异（城市0.912，时期0.833）。

Conclusion: 这项研究提出了一种基于视觉-语言模型的多模态研究框架，以自动化和可扩展的方式分析城市街景风格差异。这种方法提高了城市形态研究的客观性和数据驱动特性，展示了该方法在量化和解释城市风格演变方面的潜力。

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

Method: 研究中引入了一种可扩展的方法，将视频注释为交错的多模态序列。设计了一种块因果扩散变压器，并在三个代理任务上进行训练：下一张图像预测、当前分割预测和下一个分割预测。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在上下文图像编辑中的能力强，并在两个多步图像编辑基准测试中取得了最新的成果。尽管模型仅在视频上进行训练，但也展示了在多概念组合、故事生成和编辑链应用中的有希望的能力。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新的方法，通过从视频中直接学习来实现上下文图像编辑。该方法在多概念组合、故事生成和连续编辑应用中表现出有希望的能力。

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

TL;DR: 新任务知识图像生成提出，MMMG基准测试显示现有图像生成模型推理力不足，推出FLUX-Reason作为开源基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管知识图像在历史上对人类文明和人类学习机制具有重要意义，但生成这类图像仍然具有挑战性，需要将世界知识与像素级的视觉信息融合。

Method: 引入了一个新的任务知识图像生成，并创建了MMMG基准测试，通过统一的知识图谱表示进行评估，并引入了MMMG-Score作为度量指标。

Result: 通过对16个最先进的文本到图像生成模型进行全面评估，发现这些模型在推理能力上存在明显的不足，最好的GPT-4o也仅得到50.20的MMMG-Score。

Conclusion: 现有的图像生成模型在知识图像生成任务上存在严重的推理欠缺问题，新的基准测试MMMG揭示了这些模型在实体忠实度、关系等方面的不足，并通过MMMG-Score进行量化评估。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

TL;DR: Pisces, a novel multimodal model, excels in both understanding and generating images by utilizing separate visual encoders and optimized training, achieving competitive results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge that unified models often underperform compared to specialized models in image understanding and generation due to the distinct training processes and visual feature requirements.

Method: The paper introduces Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model with a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques for multimodal generation.

Result: Pisces shows competitive performance on over 20 benchmarks for image understanding and exhibits robust generative capabilities on GenEval, a benchmark for image generation.

Conclusion: Pisces demonstrates strong performance and robustness in both image understanding and generation, proving the effectiveness of separate visual encoders in unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

### [243] [Starting Positions Matter: A Study on Better Weight Initialization for Neural Network Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10463)
*Stone Yun,Alexander Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 我们研究了不同权重初始化对量化的影响，提出 GHN-QAT 方法提升量化准确性，尤其在低位量化中显著有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化特定的模型开发技术可以极大地提高现代 DNN 的准确性和鲁棒性，但几乎没有探索量化训练的初始条件改进。因此，我们探索对量化的 DNN 进行更好的权重初始化。

Method: 我们进行了广泛的研究，考察不同权重初始化方法对常用的 CNN 结构块量化鲁棒性的影响，并探索了一种新的 CNN 初始化方法，使用图超网络（GHN）预测量化 DNN 的参数。

Result: 研究表明，不同的随机权重初始化器选择会显著影响最终的量化鲁棒性。通过对 GHN 进行微调（GHN-QAT），可以进一步提高 CNN 的量化精度，特别是在 4 位和 2 位量化中展现了显著的准确性提升。

Conclusion: 我们首次深入研究了量化感知神经网络权重初始化，并提出了 GHN-QAT 方法来改进量化的 DNN 的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

TL;DR: 提出了PSLG-SAM框架，通过分解任务和减少训练依赖，提高了RRSIS任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RRSIS任务面临着密集标注要求和复杂场景解读的挑战。

Method: 提出名为PSLG-SAM的框架，将RRSIS任务分解为两个阶段：粗定位和精细分割。在粗定位阶段，视觉定位网络大致定位文本描述的对象。在精细分割阶段，第一阶段的坐标指导增强的SAM进行精确分割。

Result: 在两个数据集(RRSIS-D和RRSIS-M)上的实验验证显示，PSLG-SAM相比现有模型取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: PSLG-SAM框架在RRSIS任务中实现了显著的性能提升，超越了现有的最先进模型。

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 细粒度的幻觉批判是一种有效且可推广的目标，能够提升视觉-语言模型的视觉感知能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

Motivation: 尽管视频大语言模型在多模态理解方面取得了进展，但在处理具有上下文依赖的流视频推理时仍面临挑战。现有方法过多依赖历史背景信息，带来数据处理负担，并可能干扰模型对关键信息的识别。

Method: 该研究利用视觉流压缩和历史对话检索来进行流视频推理，并提出CogReasoner模型作为基准。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的任务——上下文引导流视频推理(CogStream)，并开发了一种基准模型CogReasoner，以应对流视频推理中的上下文依赖性问题。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

Abstract: Explaining why the species lives at a particular location is important for
understanding ecological systems and conserving biodiversity. However, existing
ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists.
We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species
image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The
system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval,
pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal
structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,
showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended
ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in
human-understandable language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高性能面部识别系统在人口统计偏差检测方面，尤其是在分数分布尾部的微妙差异方面，存在不足。

Method: CEI方法通过单独分析真实和假冒得分分布，聚焦于尾部概率，同时考虑整体分布形状。实验包括评估最先进的面部识别系统、有意偏向的模型和各种数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，CEI比现有方法更能检测出细微的偏见，并通过CEI^A自动化版本提升了客观性和简化应用。

Conclusion: 提出的CEI方法在评估面部生物识别技术中的偏见方面表现出色，可广泛应用于任何需要分析分布尾部的统计问题。

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的电子商务和数字营销视频生成框架常常不能同时保持人物和产品的身份，或者缺乏对人物产品空间关系的理解，导致不真实的表现和不自然的互动。

Method: 该方法通过注入配对的人物产品参考信息，并利用额外的掩码交叉注意力机制，实现对人物身份和产品细节的保留。

Result: 在大型数据集上训练的该方法，在保持人物和产品身份完整性以及生成真实演示动作方面超越了现有技术。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种基于Diffusion Transformer(DiT)框架的方法，解决现有视频生成框架难以同时保持人物和产品的真实性问题。

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

Conclusion: TexTailor在合成视角一致性纹理方面优于现有方法，并提供了源代码供研究和应用。

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

*Francisco Caetano,Christiaan Viviers,Peter H. N. De With,Fons van der Sommen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SymmFlow is a new model unifying segmentation, classification, and image generation, achieving state-of-the-art results in image synthesis and competitive performance in other tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified model that can handle semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation effectively while maintaining generative diversity.

Method: Symmetrical Flow Matching which unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation into a single model using a symmetric learning objective.

Result: SymmFlow achieves FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps, demonstrating competitive performance across tasks.

Conclusion: SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic image synthesis and provides competitive results in semantic segmentation and classification tasks.

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

*Marzieh Oghbaie,Teresa Araújoa,Hrvoje Bogunović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR:  PiPViT改善了原型方法在医学影像中的可解释性，利用视觉变换器学习可解释的图像原型，并在视网膜OCT图像分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型方法通过学习细粒度的部分原型提高可解释性，但在输入的像素空间中的可视化不总是与人类可理解的生物标志物一致。众所周知的原型方法通常学习非常细粒度的原型，而在医学影像中，这些原型的可解释性较差，因为生物标志物和病变的存在和程度都很重要。

Method: 我们提出了一种固有可解释的原型模型PiPViT（基于补丁的视觉可解释原型）用于图像识别。PiPViT利用视觉变换器（ViT）来捕获补丁之间的远程依赖关系，学习鲁棒的、人类可解释的原型，仅使用图像级标签来近似病变程度。此外，PiPViT从对比学习和多分辨率输入处理中受益，可以跨尺度有效定位生物标志物。

Result: PiPViT在四个数据集上的视网膜OCT图像分类中进行了评估，取得了与最先进方法竞争的定量性能，同时提供了更有意义的解释。此外，在一个保留的测试集上的定量评估证实学习的原型在语义和临床上是相关的。

Conclusion: PiPViT能够透明地解释其决策，并协助临床医生理解诊断结果。

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的应用（如机器人和自动驾驶汽车）需要模型能够同时处理实例和类别的分类任务，因此在论文中引入了同时进行实例和类别持续学习的任务，以应对这一挑战。

Method: 提出了一种名为HyperCLIC的持续学习算法，该算法利用双曲空间来建模等级关系。双曲空间能够以低失真和紧凑的嵌入表示类似树状的结构。框架中结合了双曲分类和蒸馏目标，促进等级关系的持续嵌入。并引入了持续等级指标来评估性能。

Result: 在EgoObjects数据集上验证了所提出方法，在处理多个粒度层次下表现有效，提高了等级泛化效果。

Conclusion: HyperCLIC算法在多个粒度上操作有效，提升了等级泛化能力，证明其在动态现实环境中的复杂等级对象识别任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

Motivation: 自注意力机制是基于Transformer的深度学习架构的基石，但其原因和局限性难以解释，因此需要建立一个稳固的理论基础来解释其成功和挑战。

Method: 本文提出了一个统一的图像处理框架，解释自注意力计算及其组成部分如位置编码和残差连接的作用，并引入了两个独立的架构修改。

Result: 通过将图像处理灵感的修改应用于Transformer中，实验证明这些修改能够提高任务的准确性、在数据污染和对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，以及对长序列任务的理解能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅提升了对自注意力机制的解释能力，还在一定程度上提高了模型在各类任务中的表现。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

TL;DR: 通过深度学习生成的合成黄金标准，提高了InP晶圆制造中的缺陷检测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于在InP多项目晶圆制造中，生产规模较小且设计变化大，通常不存在已知的黄金标准，因此缺陷检测需要手动完成且耗费大量人力。

Method: 该方法利用深度神经网络，从CAD数据中训练以生成逼真的InP晶圆图像。评估过程中，使用合成数据和实际InP晶圆照片对模拟图像的质量进行了评估，并将其应用于模板匹配中进行缺陷检测。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种利用深度神经网络生成合成黄金标准的方法，其中模拟仿真出的InP晶圆图像用于有效地进行检测，提高了表面缺陷的检测效率。

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

Motivation: 现有的任意倍数图像超分辨率方法在上采样倍数超过训练数据范围时性能显著下降，导致模糊。提出方法旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种统一模型，称为基于笔画的循环放大器（SbCA），通过将图像分解为矢量图形作为笔画来放大，并使用细节补全模块恢复缺失的细节。循环策略通过对细节进行迭代优化，实现了超大倍数的上采样。

Result: 我们的方法有效解决了分布漂移问题，消除伪影、噪声和模糊，产生高质量、高分辨率的超分辨率图像。实验验证表明，我们的方法在超大倍数上采样任务上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在超大倍数上采样任务中显著优于现有方法，提供了远超现有技术的视觉质量。

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种专为视频抠图设计的PTQ框架，首次系统性地解决了视频抠图中PTQ面临的挑战，并在不同位宽下取得了最先进的精度。

Motivation: 随着视频抠图在影视制作和虚拟现实等应用中的重要性增加，将计算密集型模型部署在资源受限设备上的挑战需要通过模型压缩和加速技术来解决，而后训练量化（PTQ）在保持准确性和时间一致性上面临显著挑战。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的两阶段PTQ策略，包括基于块重建的优化和全局量化参数校准，以及统计驱动的全局仿射校准（GAC）方法，并结合光流辅助（OFA）组件来增强模型区分复杂场景中运动前景的能力。

Conclusion: 提出的PTQ4VM框架在视频抠图领域的量化模型中取得了最先进的精度性能，特别是在不同的位宽下表现优异，4-bit PTQ4VM在性能上接近全精度模型，同时节省8倍的FLOP。

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for

pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on

Motivation: 现有的ZSGM方法假设图像偏移和文本偏移在CLIP嵌入空间中完全对齐，这导致生成图像的质量下降。本文旨在分析偏移不对齐现象并提出改进方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为AIR（Adaptation with Iterative Refinement）的方法，该方法通过对偏移不对齐的迭代改进提高目标域图像质量。

Result: 在26个实验设置中进行了定性、定量和用户研究，结果表明，提出的AIR方法在质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的AIR方法显著提高了生成图像的质量，实验表明该方法达到了当前最先进的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

Conclusion: M4V框架提供了一种高效的文本到视频生成方法，通过减少计算开销同时提升视觉质量，因此对于多模态和时空视频生成任务更具实用性。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

Motivation: 自回归视觉生成因其可扩展性和与其他模态的兼容性受到越来越多的关注。现有方法通常采用空间补丁进行自回归生成，但这与自回归模型的因果性相悖。

Method: 该方法首先将图像通过嵌套频谱标记化转换为有序的频谱标记，然后使用粗细逐渐的方式进行自回归生成。

Result: SpectralAR在ImageNet-1K数据集上进行图像重建和自回归生成实验，使用仅64个标记和310M参数取得了3.02的gFID。

Conclusion: SpectralAR通过频谱视角实现了视觉序列的因果关系，并且在ImageNet-1K数据集上取得了优异的重建和生成性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

Method: 本文提出了一种新的视觉token修剪方法CDPruner，定义了条件相似性，然后通过行列式点过程（DPP）最大化选择子集中保留token的条件多样性。

Result: CDPruner在各类视觉-语言基准上建立了新的最先进水平，在应用于LLaVA时，FLOPs减少了95%，CUDA延迟减少了78%，同时维持了94%的原有准确率。

Conclusion: CDPruner通过最大化条件多样性，并且与用户指令紧密结合，显著减少了视觉和语言模型中的推理成本，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

TL;DR: 引入HeadHunter和SoftPAG框架，实现细粒度的注意力扰动选择，优化生成质量和视觉特性控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有注意力扰动方法缺乏确定应用扰动位置的原则性方法，特别是在Diffusion Transformer架构中。因此，研究了注意力扰动的细粒度问题，以改进生成质量和视觉属性控制。

Method: 本文通过头猎人（HeadHunter）框架和SoftPAG方法，对注意力头从头部级别到单个注意力头的粒度范围进行分析和优化，以实现用户目标的细粒度控制。

Result: 所提出的方法在大型DiT架构的文本到图像模型上表现优越，尤其是在生成质量提升和风格特定指导方面，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了HeadHunter框架和SoftPAG方法，通过细粒度选择注意力头实现对生成质量和视觉属性的精细控制，并在大型DiT架构中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language

enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task
specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge
high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive
experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this
context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing
challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering
farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these
technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce
additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly
challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with
existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic
mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots
through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language
into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

Motivation: Visual-and-Language Navigation (VLN) 需要智能体解释自然语言指令并在视觉丰富且不熟悉的环境中导航，给智能AI带来了复杂的挑战。

Method: 我们提出了一种模块化、即插即用的导航框架，将视觉语言的理解与动作规划分离。通过集成冻结的视觉语言模型Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct和轻量级的规划逻辑，我们旨在在不进行广泛模型微调的情况下实现灵活、快速和适应性的导航。

Conclusion: 我们的模块化方法为可扩展和高效的导航系统奠定了基础，强调通过改善环境先验知识和扩大多模态输入集成来实现未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded
in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and
road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in
a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology
prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our
method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their
association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to
comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and
conditions.

Motivation: 研究驾驶场景下参数的联合概率分布对基于场景的安全评估至关重要，其风险量化依赖于具体参数组合的可能性。

Method: 采用高斯混合Copula模型，并对其与以往提出的高斯混合模型和高斯Copula模型进行基准测试。

Result: 在用来自联合国法规第157号定义场景的现实世界驾驶数据进行的1800万场景实例评估中，高斯混合Copula模型在可能性和Sinkhorn距离方面对数据的拟合更好。

Conclusion: 高斯混合Copula模型为未来基于场景的验证框架提供了引人注目的基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

Motivation: 在工业规模的实际环境中，机器人操作需要提高性能，而多吸盘机器人抓取则是其一个重要且具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 利用多模态视觉编码器预测机器人抓取的成功率，结合多模态预训练和微调进行策略训练。

Result: 通过多个数据集进行实验评估，结果显示多模态训练的重要性，以及在微调和推理时仅使用部分模态输入的能力。

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

Motivation: 自动机器人领域中的视觉和语言导航面临两个关键瓶颈：对分布外环境的泛化能力和对固定离散动作空间的依赖。

Method: VLFly框架由三个模块组成：基于大语言模型（LLM）的指令编码器、由视觉语言模型（VLM）驱动的目标检索器和生成可执行轨迹的航点规划器。

Conclusion: VLFly在各种模拟环境中表现优异，并且在实际世界的室内和室外任务中展示了其稳健的开放词汇目标理解和泛化导航能力，即使在抽象语言输入的情况下。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural
Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,
uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights
demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through

global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

TL;DR: 该研究通过将个性化生成的音乐与环境噪声相结合，有效降低噪声可察觉性，改善声学体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传统的声音遮掩技术在掩盖噪声时需要增加音量，而音量过大可能导致不适。因此作者希望通过将噪音与用户提供文本提示生成的个性化音乐融合，以减少环境噪声的可察觉性。

Method: 本文提出了BNMusic框架，该框架分为两个关键阶段：首先合成一段完整的音乐片段，包括噪声的音乐本质；其次自适应地放大生成的音乐段落，以减少噪声感知。

Result: 实验表明，BNMusic框架在MusicBench、EPIC-SOUNDS和ESC-50数据集上的表现证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过融合个性化音乐与环境噪声，可以有效降低噪声的可察觉性，从而改善整体声学体验。

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Conclusion: 在n人公共物品博弈中，非合作的纳什均衡是边际不稳定的，一个发展出亲社会行为的个体能够带动几乎整个群体朝合作状态转变。

Abstract: Happiness, in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, was understood quite
differently from today's popular notions of personal pleasure. Happiness
implies a flourishing life - one of virtue, purpose, and contribution to the
common good. This paper studies populations of individuals - that we call
homo-felix - who maximise an objective function that we call happiness. The
happiness of one individual depends on the payoffs that they receive in games
they play with their peers as well as on the happiness of the peers they
interact with. Individuals care more or less about others depending on whether
that makes them more or less happy. This paper analyses the happiness feedback
loops that result from these interactions in simple settings. We find that
individuals tend to care more about individuals who are happier than what they
would be by being selfish. In simple 2 x 2 game theoretic settings, we show
that homo-felix can converge to a variety of equilibria which includes but goes
beyond Nash equilibria. In an n-persons public good game we show that the
non-cooperative Nash equilibrium is marginally unstable and a single individual
who develops prosocial behaviour is able to drive almost the whole population
to a cooperative state.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 展示Gittins指数在实际应用中的潜力，改变其主要被视为理论工具的传统观念。

Method: 通过实例介绍Gittins指数，并展示其在不同问题上的应用。

Result: Gittins指数在某些问题上表现优异，例如贝叶斯优化和减少排队中的尾部延时。

Conclusion: Gittins指数不仅具有理论意义，还可以成功应用于实际问题。

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly
optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of
other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often
regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a
practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be
fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven
introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of
problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent
performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the
Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to
minimizing tail latency in queues.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI can effectively enhance human creativity.

Method: The paper adopts the perspective of distributed creativity, defining modes of AI contribution based on technical autonomy and perceived agency.

Result: Analysis of AI's impact on various creativity levels and discussion of implications.

Conclusion: AI can enhance human creativity through three modes: Support, Synergy, and Symbiosis.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human
creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of
how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of
distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工重新计划过程资源密集且耗时。本文提出自动化方案，以克服因解剖变化导致的质子治疗剂量分布偏移问题，保障治疗质量。

Method: 基于150分计划质量分数的奖励塑形机制，使用Deep Q-Network和Proximal Policy Optimization两种DRL算法，剂量体积直方图（DVHs）作为状态表征，22维度的行动空间用于优先级调整。

Result: 对5名头颈癌患者的评价显示，DRL代理将计划质量得分从120.63±21.40提升至139.78±6.84（DQN）和142.74±5.16（PPO），优于人类计划员生成的人工重新计划（137.20±5.58）。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种个性化深度强化学习（DRL）框架，用于自动化头颈癌强度调制质子治疗（IMPT）的重新计划，证明了DRL在解决适应性质子治疗的几何和剂量复杂性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and
organ-at-risk overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual
replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a
patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning
process as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust
optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based
approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using
their planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating
anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific
approach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling
effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network
and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state
representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.
Evaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL
agents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm
6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by
a human planner ($137.20 \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that
improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse
anatomical changes. This work demonstrates DRL's potential in addressing
geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering
efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton
therapy.

Result: 实验在AudioCaps、WavCaps和Clotho数据集上进行，并在AudioBench音频场景问答测试中验证，展示了模型的指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: 我们的模型在无需多任务指令调优的情况下展现了零样本指令遵循能力，即使仅在音频字幕数据集上训练。测试表明，该模型能够遵循多种看不见的指令。

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

Abstract: Voice conversion has emerged as a pivotal technology in numerous applications

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合新损失函数和说话者代码的语音识别适配方案，显著提高了少量数据下的适配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的语音识别通常只能在特定环境下表现最佳，难以适配新说话者，特别是当数据较少且未标注时，微调难以具备鲁棒性。为解决这些问题，本研究旨在开发一种通过结合不同方法使适配在极少数据上也能具有鲁棒性的方案。

Method: 论文通过提出一种新的损失函数——完整假设的条件熵，并采用多种假设来提升识别适配精度。此外，采用一种简称为“说话者代码”的向量来表示说话者，该向量短到仅需少量数据即可进行估计。

Result: 在远场噪声增强版本的Common Voice数据集上，该方法提升了一分钟适配数据的单词错误率20%的相对改进，并在十分钟的数据上进一步提升至29%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种通过结合候选方案来实现在单分钟数据上进行稳健适配的方法。主要采用条件熵作为新损失函数和短向量的“说话者代码”，以应对非理想的初始识别结果与较短的数据需求。实验结果表明，这种方案在单分钟数据适配上取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的基于最小深度的特征选择方法，在双不平衡条件下，通过利用树拓扑结构评估变量相关性，在随机森林中实现更准确和简洁的变量子集。

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in high-dimensional classification
tasks, particularly under challenging conditions of double imbalance, namely
settings characterized by both class imbalance in the response variable and
dimensional asymmetry in the data $(n \gg p)$. In such scenarios, traditional
feature selection methods applied to Random Forests (RF) often yield unstable
or misleading importance rankings. This paper proposes a novel thresholding
scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth, which exploits the tree
topology to assess variable relevance. Extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more
parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal
depth-based selection. The method provides a practical and interpretable
solution for variable selection in RF under double imbalance conditions.

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled
with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The
neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical
circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear
responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be
performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network
was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic
time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through
manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical
responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive
components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the
memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was
found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to
learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical
neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical
systems using only external control parameters.

TL;DR: The paper explores how different hidden unit activations in RBMs affect their memory retrieval abilities, showing that enhanced hidden designs lead to better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is driven by the need to understand how the prior distribution and architectural choices in RBMs influence their phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities, aiming to enhance their performance as associative memories.

Method: The authors use analytical tools from statistical physics, specifically the theory of disordered systems, and perform finite-size Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the properties of RBMs with various hidden unit activations.

Result: The analysis shows that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes have reduced critical capacity, limiting their associative memory functionality. However, by modifying the model with local biases and different hidden unit priors, these limitations can be overcome, improving recall performance considerably.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the design of hidden units in Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) is critical for enhancing their efficiency and expressive power, particularly for improving memory retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of
bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units -
including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections
to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics
of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation
functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis
reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity
suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as
associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such
as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These
adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall
performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported
by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit
design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

Motivation: 传统线性流动控制策略在强干扰序列中可能失效，需发展更有效策略来调节气动升力。

Method: 通过使用Transformer结合强化学习的方法来学习一种有效的控制策略，并利用专家策略进行预训练以及任务级别的迁移学习加速训练。

Result: 所学习的策略超过了最佳比例控制，尤其在阵风数量增加时优势明显，并且可以从少量连续阵风环境有效泛化到长序列环境。在四分之一弦的俯仰控制下，升力调节效果优于中弦俯仰，同时所需控制努力较少。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于Transformer的强化学习框架在处理多阵风环境中表现出色，能够在较少控制努力的情况下实现优异的升力调节，显示出良好的普适性。

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain
effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions,
but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the
present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic
lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the
challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We
demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --
pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level
transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to
multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best
proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts
increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number
of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with
an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration
and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift
regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord
pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this
advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord
pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of
the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach
to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined
with the proposed acceleration techniques.

TL;DR: OmniFluids, a physics pre-trained operator learning framework, achieves significant efficiency and accuracy improvements in fluid dynamics simulation, outperforming existing AI methods with fast inference under limited data conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computational fluid dynamics methods require high computational costs due to reliance on fine meshes, while existing AI-driven methods face issues like extensive retraining or large dataset demands. Thus, there's a need for efficient models that can work under limited data availability.

Method: The key components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder, and factorized Fourier layers, enabling efficient and scalable modeling with seamless integration with physics-based supervision.

Result: OmniFluids outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy, delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data.

Conclusion: OmniFluids establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in
various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational
fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed
convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques.
However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely
data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware
methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss
functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing
coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce
OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that
integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and
few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction
under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key
components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder,
and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of
diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with
physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional
benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven
methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy,
delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately
recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work
establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling
in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

TL;DR: scSSL-Bench评估了19种SSL方法在单细胞数据上的表现，发现随机掩蔽为最优增强技术，表明对单细胞多模式集成框架的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了推动我们对应用于单细胞数据的SSL方法的理解，我们提出了一个综合评估SSL方法的基准，旨在提供标准化评价平台和具体应用建议。

Method: 我们介绍了scSSL-Bench，这是一个综合基准，用于评估十九种SSL方法。我们的评估涵盖了九个数据集，侧重于三个常见的下游任务：批处理校正，细胞类型注释和缺失模态预测。此外，我们系统地评估了各种数据增强策略。

Result: 我们的分析揭示了任务特定的权衡，表明需要一个专用的单细胞多模式数据集成框架。随机掩蔽作为所有任务中的最有效增强技术。此外，特定框架和通用方法在不同任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 我们的分析揭示了任务特定的权衡：专用的单细胞框架（如scVI、CLAIRE和微调后的scGPT）在单模式批处理校正中表现出色，而通用的SSL方法（如VICReg和SimCLR）在细胞类型和多模式数据集成中表现更佳。此外，随机掩蔽作为跨所有任务的最有效增强技术，优于领域特定的增强。这表明需要一个专用的单细胞多模式数据集成框架。scSSL-Bench提供了一个标准化的评估平台，并为将SSL应用于单细胞分析提供了具体建议，推动了深度学习与单细胞基因组学的融合。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data
integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform
and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis,
advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.

TL;DR: 研究介绍了Nullsettes预测任务，发现突变效应预测性能与非突变预测可能性强相关，受序列长度影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了让基因组语言模型不仅学习进化的合理性，还要学习序列与功能的关系，以促进功能性DNA序列的生成。

Method: 引入了一组称为Nullsettes的预测任务，用于评估模型预测通过转移关键控制元件在合成表达盒中产生的功能丧失突变的能力。

Result: 突变效应预测性能与非突变序列预测可能性呈强相关，且强模型性能的预测可能性值受序列长度高度依赖。

Conclusion: 研究表明，预测突变影响的表现与预测非突变序列的可能性有很强的相关性，并且强模型表现的可能性值范围高度依赖于序列长度。

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过识别同质患者子群，可以发现特定于这些子群的疾病途径和治疗方法。

Method: 设计了一种类似于Goemans和Williamson在1994年提出的圆整技术，该技术可以在0.82的因子内近似底层优化问题的最优解。

Result: 算法成功应用于乳腺癌的RNA微阵列数据集中，并能够识别出包含转移病例的同质患者子群，其结果展示了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种高效算法，能够从大规模的非均质数据集中识别出同质子集。

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for
identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large
inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

TL;DR: 数字记忆计算机通过优化参数提高组合优化问题的求解效率，强调记忆和超参数的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数字记忆计算机的参数如何影响其求解组合优化问题的效率。

Method: 利用数值模拟，分析原型DMM的物理参数对相空间探索效率的影响。

Result: 发现DMM在广泛参数范围内高效探索相空间，记忆和快速自由度之间的动态耦合产生长期相关性，优化解的探索效率。

Conclusion: 参数优化对DMM的相空间工程非常重要，关系到计算效率。

Abstract: Digital Memcomputing machines (DMMs) are dynamical systems with memory (time
non-locality) that have been designed to solve combinatorial optimization
problems. Their corresponding ordinary differential equations depend on a few
hyper-parameters that define both the system's relevant time scales and its
phase-space geometry. Using numerical simulations on a prototypical DMM, we
analyze the role of these physical parameters in engineering the phase space to
either help or hinder the solution search by DMMs. We find that the DMM
explores its phase space efficiently for a wide range of parameters, aided by
the long-range correlations in their fast degrees of freedom that emerge
dynamically due to coupling with the (slow) memory degrees of freedom. In this
regime, the time it takes for the system to find a solution scales well as the
number of variables increases. When these hyper-parameters are chosen poorly,
the system navigates its phase space far less efficiently. However, we find
that, in many cases, dynamical long-range order (DLRO) persists even when the
phase-space exploration process is inefficient. DLRO only disappears if the
memories are made to evolve as quickly as the fast degrees of freedom. This
study points to the important role of memory and hyper-parameters in
engineering the DMMs' phase space for optimal computational efficiency.

*Fuhan Cai,Yong Guo,Jie Li,Wenbo Li,Xiangzhong Fang,Jian Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FastFLUX通过架构级剪枝和局部微调方法，提高了FLUX的推理效率，保持高图像质量，速度显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的加速方法常导致性能显著下降且训练成本高，为了解决这些问题，我们提出了FastFLUX。

Method: 提出了一种称为FastFLUX的架构级剪枝框架，采用BRLL方法，以及Sandwich Training策略进行局部微调。

Result: 实验表明，FastFLUX在修剪20%结构层级后，依然能够在图像质量上保持高水平，且推理速度显著提升。

Conclusion: FastFLUX有效解决了FLUX模型在推理效率上的不足，显著提升了速度且保持了图像质量。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架利用低质量、合成和分布外图像训练扩散模型，显著提高了图像质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通常扩散模型在策划好的数据集上进行训练，而这些数据集常来自高度筛选的数据池。因此，研究者希望通过利用那些通常被丢弃的低质量图像来改进扩散模型。

Method: 提出了Ambient Diffusion Omni，一个简单且有原则的框架，可以在训练过程中从所有可用图像中提取信号。该框架利用自然图像的两个性质——光谱幂律衰减和局部性。

Result: 使用框架取得了ImageNet FID的最先进性能，并在文本生成图像过程中在图像质量和多样性上都有显著改进。

Conclusion: 我们展示了通过使用低质量、合成和分布外的图像来提高扩散模型的质量。这一方法可以从通常被丢弃的低质量图像中提取有价值的信息，展示了低质量图像的巨大价值。

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的密度均化映射方法，解决了传统方法的准确性和适应性问题，并无缝支持2D到3D的推广。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的密度均化映射方法经常面临准确性不足、在极端情况下产生重叠伪影以及从2D扩展到3D时需要大量算法重新设计的问题。因此，我们需要一种更准确和鲁棒的密度均化映射方法，该方法能够有效处理各种形状变形并适应不同维度。

Method: 本文提出了一种全新的基于深度学习的密度均化映射（LDEM）框架，使用深度神经网络，并引入可以强制密度一致性和几何规则性的损失函数，同时采用分层方法在粗和密层级预测变换。

Result: 通过我们的方法，可以更轻松地将表面重新网格化，产生不同的效果，并且无需对模型架构或损失函数进行结构性更改，就能从2D无缝推广到3D领域，展现出高效、稳健的密度均化映射计算能力。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种基于深度神经网络的学习型密度均化映射框架（LDEM），它比传统方法在多种简单和复杂的密度分布上表现出更优越的密度均化和单射（bijectivity）属性，并且能在不改变模型架构或损失函数的情况下，从2D无缝推广到3D领域。

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

TL;DR: 研究提出一个新框架，利用AI编译器和图数据增强技术，提高CUDA代码移植性能，在案例研究中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CUDA生态系统在并行计算领域占据主导地位，迫使其他硬件平台需要支持基于CUDA的软件。然而，CUDA代码移植到其他平台面临编程范式和硬件架构差异带来的挑战，现有方法在工作负载覆盖和通用性上存在局限，并且开发成本高。

Method: 提出一个新的框架，通过AI编译器和自动优化技术生成CUDA及对应平台的代码对，结合图数据增强方法，并引入HPCTransEval用于评估LLM在CUDA代码移植上的表现。

Result: 实验在CUDA到CPU代码移植的案例研究中进行，结果表明提出的框架显著改善了CUDA代码移植的效果。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新框架，通过结合AI编译器和自动优化技术以及图数据增强方法，提高LLM在CUDA代码移植上的性能。实验结果显示，框架显著提升了CUDA到其他平台代码的转换效果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

Method: 使用分层图表示法，每个时间步骤都与交通网络的一个副本相关联。然后应用A-Star启发式算法计算近似最优的防守策略。

Result: 通过与用于防守者的混合整数线性规划（MILP）方法比较，该方法在计算效率和解决方案质量上表现优异。结果表明该方法能够有效解决问题复杂性并在短时间内提供高质量解决方案。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效地解决了动态犯罪环境中拦截犯罪的问题，并在计算效率和解决方案质量上表现出色。

Abstract: Intercepting a criminal using limited police resources presents a significant
challenge in dynamic crime environments, where the criminal's location
continuously changes over time. The complexity is further heightened by the
vastness of the transportation network. To tackle this problem, we propose a
layered graph representation, in which each time step is associated with a
duplicate of the transportation network. For any given set of attacker
strategies, a near-optimal defender strategy is computed using the A-Star
heuristic algorithm applied to the layered graph. The defender's goal is to
maximize the probability of successful interdiction. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed method by comparing it with a Mixed-Integer Linear
Programming (MILP) approach used for the defender. The comparison considers
both computational efficiency and solution quality. The results demonstrate
that our approach effectively addresses the complexity of the problem and
delivers high-quality solutions within a short computation time.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一种无需训练的新方法，能通过合成数据提高大语言模型的安全对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）的安全对齐需要大量人工标注的偏好数据，这个过程既昂贵又耗时。

Method: 引入了一种名为拒绝感知自适应注入（RAAI）的框架，这是一种简单、无需训练且与模型无关的方法。它通过检测内部拒绝信号并自适应地注入预定义短语，诱导出有害但流畅的生成结果。

Result: RAAI有效地突破了LLM的限制，将有害响应率从2.15%提高到平均61.04%。通过使用RAAI生成的合成数据进行微调，提高了模型对抗有害提示的能力，同时保持了模型在标准任务上的通常能力。

Conclusion: 攻击方法可以重新定义为可扩展和可控的安全对齐工具。

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）在代码生成中对越狱攻击的特定脆弱性，以评估它们在应对这些威胁时的鲁棒性。

Method: MalwareBench基准数据集的设计，包括320个手工制作的恶意代码生成需求，涵盖11种越狱方法和29种代码功能类别。

Result: 实验表明，多种越狱方法的结合进一步降低了模型的安全能力，恶意内容的平均拒绝率为60.93%，而结合越狱攻击算法后下降至39.92%。

Conclusion: 主流的大型语言模型在拒绝恶意代码生成请求方面能力有限，尤其是当多种越狱攻击方法结合使用时，模型的安全能力显著降低。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened
concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak
attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While
prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs,
their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains
largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark
dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation,
designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based
on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11
jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that
mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation
requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces
the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for
malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak
attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of
LLMs still pose significant challenges.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）会记忆，包括可能泄露不应存储的个人可识别信息（PII）。本研究的动机是防止PII泄露。

Method: 我们检测到被记住的PII，然后通过编辑模型对其训练数据的知识来减轻PII的记忆。

Result: PME方案增强模型对抗隐私训练数据提取攻击的能力，并在不影响语言模型的情况下使其更健壮。

Conclusion: PME能有效减少多种配置下泄露的PII数量，有时甚至能将隐私攻击的准确性降至零。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image
knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals
into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers
and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals
survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual
generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across
diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and
reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

TL;DR: 提出了GenBreak框架，通过微调语言模型开发对抗性提示，以测试T2I模型的安全性，显示了当前解决方案存在的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前文本到图像（T2I）模型快速发展，但由于其可能被误用生成有害内容，带来安全风险。因此需要可靠的方法评估T2I模型的安全性。

Method: 提出了GenBreak框架，通过对一个大型语言模型（LLM）进行微调，结合监督微调和强化学习，开发出具备规避能力和图像毒性的对抗性提示。

Result: GenBreak在对商业T2I生成器的黑盒攻击中表现出色，揭示了一些实用且令人担忧的安全弱点。

Conclusion: 文章认为，尽管现有研究存在局限，但通过如GenBreak等新方法，能够更有效地评估并提升T2I模型的安全性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为CMPL的对话隐私审计框架，以多轮交互探测来揭示语言模型代理的潜在隐私漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型代理作为个人助理、客服机器人和临床助手的出现，这些应用虽然提供了显著的运营优势，但也需要不断访问敏感数据，从而增加了未经授权泄露的风险。

Method: 采用迭代探测策略来测试实施严格隐私指令的对话代理，模拟真实的多轮交互以系统性揭示潜在漏洞。

Result: 在多样领域、数据模态和安全配置下进行的评估显示，该审计框架能够揭露当前单轮防御机制无法阻止的隐私风险。

Conclusion: CMPL框架能够有效揭示现有单轮对话防御机制未能阻止的隐私风险。

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

TL;DR: 研究评估了机器遗忘方法在提示攻击下的有效性，发现一些方法仍然脆弱，并提供了评估框架供公众使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了探讨机器遗忘方法在面对提示攻击时的有效性，我们研究了多种遗忘技术的表现并提出需要更好的评估框架。

Method: 系统评估了八种遗忘技术，采用输出为基础、logit为基础和探针分析法来评估未学习知识被恢复的程度。

Result: 结果表明，RMU和TAR等方法表现出稳健的遗忘能力，而ELM对特定提示攻击仍然脆弱。logit分析显示未学习的模型没有通过修改格式隐藏知识。

Conclusion: 现有的一些机器遗忘方法在面对简单的提示攻击时可能失效，需要更可靠的评估框架来区分真正的知识移除和表面的输出抑制。

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在微调时经常涉及私密或敏感信息，因此存在严重的隐私问题。作者研究了微调LLM易受成员推断攻击（MIA）影响的脆弱性，并提出了防御方案。

Method: 提出了一种名为SOFT的防御技术，通过选择性的数据模糊化，在LLM微调过程中利用有影响力的数据选择与可调整的参数来平衡效用保留和隐私保护。

Result: 在多个领域和不同规模架构的LLM中进行的广泛实验表明，SOFT有效降低了隐私风险，同时保持了良好的模型性能。

Conclusion: SOFT方法在有效减少隐私风险的同时，保持了竞争性的模型性能，为保护微调大型语言模型中的敏感信息提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely
adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often
involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns.
In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the
vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during
fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information.
These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT
(\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM
\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates
privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable
parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive
experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales.
Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining
competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to
safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在推理技术和应用上进行了许多单独评估，但其联合规范和组合应用没有得到充分探索。明确多智能体LLM系统的规范对于探索它们在特定应用中的潜力和适用性是必要的。

Method: 该研究采用多智能体系统架构，并扩展之前的研究，介绍了一个多智能体系统的规范。

Conclusion: 研究展示通过多智能体系统评估和规范LLM的潜在应用可行性，尤其是针对网络安全和服务器安全任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g.,
through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For
applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based
multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining
reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications
might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents.
However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques,
and applications individually, their joint specification and combined
application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM
systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for
specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning
techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory
research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system.
The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a
specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving
cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation
approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering,
server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by
agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的多维分类法，对LLM的防护措施进行了系统化的分析，并引入了一个名为安全-效率-效用的评估框架，用以评估其实用效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their
deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak
attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense
mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a
promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is
fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework.
In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic
analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel,
multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key
dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to
assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and
experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail
approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide
insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured
foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled
advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TED技术易受到自适应后门攻击的影响，因此需要一种更强大的防御机制。

Method: 提出了TED-LaST，结合标签监督的动态监控和自适应层重点，从而识别传统TED无法检测的潜在威胁。

Result: 实验表明，TED-LaST有效应对多种复杂的后门攻击，提升了检测能力。

Conclusion: TED-LaST显著提高了检测复杂后门攻击的能力，为DNN的安全性设立了新的基准。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model
behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be
vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological
representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,
we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow
release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that
enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key
innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.
These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade
traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological
space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data
poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced
adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious
tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST
effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,
and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for
robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against
evolving threats.

TL;DR: 本文改进了SilentBadDiffusion攻击方法，提出多元素与离散余弦变换结合的新方法，在新数据集上实现了较高的攻击效果，即使在低子采样条件下也优于原始方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于攻击Stable Diffusion（SD）的数据资源有限，存在版权和不适当内容问题，而现有的数据集中的图像也未必适合攻击，尤其是在可用于攻击的中毒样本数量较少时，SBD的表现不佳。为此，本文提出了新的数据集和改进的攻击方法以提高攻击效果。

Method: 本文提出了基于SBD的多元素（ME）攻击方法，通过增加每个中毒样本的视觉-文本元素的数量，提高攻击能力。此外，引入了离散余弦变换（DCT）以保持中毒样本的隐蔽性。

Result: 提出的ME攻击方法在新的数据集上实现了较高的攻击效果，在版权侵权率（CIR）和首次攻击周期（FAE）方面，与基准Pokemon和Mijourney数据集相比，表现出色。尤其是在低子采样比条件下，新方法优于原始SBD方法。

Conclusion: 新提出的多元素攻击方法（ME）与离散余弦变换（DCT）增强了攻击能力，在新的数据集上实现了较高的版权侵权率（CIR）和首次攻击周期（FAE），即使在低子采样条件下也优于原始的无声扩散攻击（SBD）方法。

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion
(SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to
launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text
pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew
outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the
feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even
constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or
inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are
suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning
samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets
accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME)
attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text
elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while
importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain
the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch
(FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60,
respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney
datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI
and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than
original SBD, which failed to attack at all.

TL;DR: 揭示了树环水印技术的安全漏洞，提出利用变分自编码器进行更有效攻击的方法，结果显示检测器的精确性未能满足实际需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究并揭示树环水印技术在扩散模型中潜在的安全缺陷，特别是利用公开可用的变分自编码器来进行攻击。

Method: 利用变分自编码器逼近模型的中间潜在空间进行代理攻击，而不是依赖于对攻击者能力的强假设。

Result: 通过这种方法，Tree-Ring检测器的ROC和PR曲线的AUC显著降低，同时保持了高图像质量。

Conclusion: 当前行业实践忽略了使用公共自编码器训练扩散模型存在的风险，且Tree-Ring检测器的精确性未达到实际部署需要。

Abstract: We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a
watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility
and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which
rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only
requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the
target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By
leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the
model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based
attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction
in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to
0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image
quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full
access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing
public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by
current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring
detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous
evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 现代车辆在连接性方面增加使其容易受到网络攻击，需要研究CAN网络的安全性以及对抗现有IDS系统的攻击方法。

Method: 采用了梯度式对抗攻击，评估其在白盒、灰盒和黑盒场景下的有效性。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上评估了攻击的有效性，并研究了对抗扰动对攻击影响的效果以及实时时间注入的可行性。

Conclusion: 研究证明攻击的有效性与数据集质量、目标IDS和攻击者的知识程度密切相关。

Abstract: The security of modern vehicles has become increasingly important, with the
controller area network (CAN) bus serving as a critical communication backbone
for various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The absence of robust security
measures in CAN, coupled with the increasing connectivity of vehicles, makes
them susceptible to cyberattacks. While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof. Adversarial
attacks, particularly evasion attacks, can manipulate inputs to bypass
detection by IDSs. This paper extends our previous work by investigating the
feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with
different degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs. We consider three
scenarios: white-box (attacker with full system knowledge), grey-box (partial
system knowledge), and the more realistic black-box (no knowledge of the IDS'
internal workings or data). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
attacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.
Additionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack
impact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for
timed injection based on bus traffic. Our results demonstrate that, besides
attacks being challenging due to the automotive domain constraints, their
effectiveness is strongly dependent on the dataset quality, the target IDS, and
the attacker's degree of knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的浅层安全校准技术无法检测到长远的意图，因此难以应对分解攻击，这种攻击通过将恶意目标分解为规避拒绝的看似良性子任务来实现。

Method: 我们提出了一种轻量级的顺序监控框架，通过对每个子任务的累积评估进行实时防御。

Result: 精心设计的轻量级监控器防御成功率达到93%，超越了像o3 mini这样的推理模型，同时降低了90%的成本和50%的延迟。

Conclusion: 轻量级的序列监控器在缓解分解攻击中非常有效，并且在实际部署中具有可行性。

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

Motivation: 新法西斯主义对民主与其针对的少数群体构成严重威胁，因此需要主动采取行动加以遏制。此次研究旨在弥合自然语言处理技术与政治科学之间的差距，以对抗新法西斯主义。

Method: 研究收集了大量互联网活动数据，特别是来自Iron March和Stormfront.org论坛的新法西斯群体数据，并通过众包的方式对其中一部分帖子进行了标记，以构建新的话语分类模型。

Result: 通过构建并测试话语分类模型，研究发现新法西斯言论在某些论坛中普遍存在，这为未来研究提供了良好的目标基础。

Conclusion: 研究成功构建了首个用于美国社会语境的数字话语中的新法西斯编码方案，并通过对小型语言模型和大型语言模型进行微调与测试，获得了新法西斯话语的分类模型。

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在个性化在线学习问题的解决上具有潜力，通过提供示例可以改善其生成个性化答案的效果。这可以提升学习者的参与度并减轻教师负担。

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and
accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is
crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings.
A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized
to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners'
questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators.
To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a
comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas:
language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for
validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we
generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot,
1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using
three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our
findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from
the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to
tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

Motivation: 建立生物地球化学模型参数与三维年周期稳态之间的映射，加速全球海洋生态系统模型的自旋过程。

Method: 使用带质量修正的条件变分自编码器（CVAE）进行映射。

Result: 与使用原始统一初始值相比，采用CVAE预测值可显著减少50%到95%的自旋迭代次数。

Conclusion: CVAE预测作为初始值能有效减少自旋后的迭代次数，加快模型的收敛。

Abstract: We used precomputed steady states obtained by a spin-up for a global marine
ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping from the small number of
biogeochemical model parameters onto the three-dimensional converged steady
annual cycle. The mapping was performed by a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that
the prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good
approximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the
predictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained
in the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values
for a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,
corresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the
spin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally
uniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied
stopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in
needed iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to
95\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these
results with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We
found that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 微分混合气候模型被用来优化初始条件以生成极端天气的最坏情况轨迹，比现有模型产生的更加极端的温度异常。这为探索极端天气事件的上限提供了新方法。

Motivation: 现有方法在模拟罕见高影响的极端事件时，计算成本高且准确性不足。

Method: 提出了一种结合微分混合气候模型（NeuralGCM）的框架，通过优化初始条件产生物理一致的最坏情况热浪轨迹。

Result: 对于2021年太平洋西北地区热浪，所提出的方法产生的温度异常比75成员集合中最极端的成员高出3.7摄氏度。这些轨迹显示出加强的大气阻塞和放大的罗斯贝波模式，这是严重热事件的标志。

Conclusion: 微分气候模型能够有效探索事件可能性的上限，提供了一种强有力的新方法来构建气候变化下极端天气的情景分析。

Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is
essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on
large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or
lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we
present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model,
NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent
worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest
heatwave, our method produces temperature anomalies up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above
the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature
intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns--hallmarks
of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate
models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing
a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather
under climate change.

Motivation: 提高机器学习天气预报模型的预测能力，尤其是在不同尺度上的表现。

Method: 使用多尺度损失公式进行训练和测试天气预报模型AIFS-CRPS，直接优化近乎公平的连续等级概率评分（afCRPS）。

Result: 多尺度损失公式能够更好地约束小尺度变化，同时不影响整体预测能力。

Conclusion: 多尺度损失公式在改善天气预报模型的小尺度变化约束方面表现良好，这为未来的尺度感知模型培训工作开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: We assess the impact of a multi-scale loss formulation for training
probabilistic machine-learned weather forecasting models. The multi-scale loss
is tested in AIFS-CRPS, a machine-learned weather forecasting model developed
at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS-CRPS is
trained by directly optimising the almost fair continuous ranked probability
score (afCRPS). The multi-scale loss better constrains small scale variability
without negatively impacting forecast skill. This opens up promising directions
for future work in scale-aware model training.

Abstract: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters poses
major computational challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Traditional
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow
convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the
dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we
adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity
solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve
sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate
models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).
These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical
properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and
asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching
them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our
method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical
consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient
large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous
and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.
