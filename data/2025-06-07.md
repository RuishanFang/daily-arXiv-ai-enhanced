### [1] [GEM: Empowering LLM for both Embedding Generation and Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04344)
*Caojin Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Ke Li,Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati,Benyu Zhang,Jason Liu,Serena Li,Lizhu Zhang,Xiangjun Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种方法，能够让LLMs在生成文本嵌入时无需依赖其他模型，并在保持其原始功能的情况下增强其嵌入性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的许多应用，比如检索增强生成（RAG），仍依赖于单独的嵌入模型来生成文本嵌入，这可能会使系统复杂化并在查询理解上产生差异。我们的工作旨在解决这一限制。

Method: 我们提出了一种简单的自监督方法，称为生成式嵌入大语言模型（GEM），通过插入特殊标记并操控注意力掩码以生成文本的摘要嵌入，该方法可在任何现有的大规模解码器语言模型的后期训练或微调阶段中轻松整合。

Result: 通过对1B到8B参数的两大家族的流行LLM实施我们的方法，并在文本嵌入基准（MTEB）和NLP基准（MMLU）上评估模型，结果表明我们的方法在MTEB上显著改善了原始LLMs的表现，同时对MMLU影响很小。

Conclusion: 我们的方法可以在保持原有文本生成和推理能力的同时，显著提升LLMs在文本嵌入能力方面的表现。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [2] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，ASR训练数据中更应优先增加说话人数，以增强系统对未见过口音的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立一个可以服务于全世界的自动语音识别系统，需要该系统对各种口音（包括未见过的口音）具有鲁棒性。

Method: 系统研究了训练数据中的三个变量：说话人数、每个说话人的音频时长和口音的多样性在低资源训练条件下如何影响ASR对未见过口音的鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现，在ASR训练小时数固定时，增加说话人数（意味着每个说话人贡献的较少）比增加每个说话人贡献的小时数更有利。此外，更多的说话人可以提高ASR性能，并从增加的训练小时数中获益。而在控制说话人数的情况下，优先考虑拥有不同口音的说话者的效果有限。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在自动语音识别训练数据中增加说话人数比增加每个说话人贡献的小时数更有利，这对于处理未见过口音的场景尤其重要。

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

### [3] [Mechanistic Decomposition of Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04373)
*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法，通过字典学习使句子嵌入更加可解释，并获得了关于句子嵌入的有趣见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的句子嵌入虽然在比较上比较有效，但其贡献特征难以解释，并且嵌入内容被复杂的神经转换和最终池化操作所掩盖，导致难以追溯，因此我们需要一种新方法使这些嵌入更具可解释性。

Method: 通过在token-level表示上使用字典学习，机械地将句子嵌入分解为可解释的组件，以分析池化如何将这些特征压缩为句子表示，并评估句子嵌入中的潜在特征。

Result: 通过新的方法，研究者得到了句子嵌入空间内部运作的一些有趣见解，尤其是语义和句法方面。

Conclusion: 通过我们的方法，我们获得了一些关于句子嵌入空间内在运作机制的有趣见解，例如语义和句法方面在嵌入中是线性编码的。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [4] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04381)
*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的HTC模型HTC-CLIP，结合两种现有方法，通过对比学习提高分类性能，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的HTC模型无法同时充分利用文本编码和标签层次结构的特点，因此需要一种新的方法整合这两者，提高分类效果。

Method: 提出HTC-CLIP方法，利用对比学习进行层次感知文本表示和路径引导层次表示的学习。在训练过程中学习两个不同的类概率分布，并在推断时使用这两种概率的合并结果。

Result: 在两个公共基准数据集上的测试显示，使用HTC-CLIP模型在宏F1分数上比现有最先进模型提高了0.99 - 2.37%。

Conclusion: HTC-CLIP可以有效结合现有的两种方法，提升层次文本分类的性能，在两个公共基准数据集上，宏F1分数比现有最先进模型提高了0.99 - 2.37%。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [5] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在马耳他语的生成任务中，许多大语言模型表现较差，小型微调模型表现更佳。同时，先前接触语言和微调对模型性能有重要影响。微调成本虽高但效益更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型在低资源语言中的表现仍然有限，研究旨在评估其在马耳他语上的表现。

Method: 通过使用新引入的基准进行11个辨别和生成任务评估55个大规模语言模型在马耳他语上的表现。

Result: 小型模型经微调后在马耳他语的生成任务上表现更佳，先前的训练暴露和微调指导对表现有重要影响。

Conclusion: 在评估55个貌似语言模型在低资源语言马耳他语的表现后，研究发现，模型在生成任务上的表现较差，小型微调模型在所有任务上表现更佳。先前预训练阶段接触马耳他语和指导微调是最重要的因素。微调虽然初始成本较高，但表现更佳且推理成本较低。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [6] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个通过少量标记样本在多个领域通用的意图分类器模型，实验显示其准确率大幅提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域数据的获取困难限制了意图分类器的性能，因此开发能够在不同域（渠道、地理位置、语言）上通用的意图分类器具有实际价值，特别是在只有少量标注的情况下。

Method: 提出了一种embedder-cum-classifier模型架构，结合了监督微调（使用各向同性正则化器）和多语言知识蒸馏策略，训练一个域特定的句子嵌入器，然后通过一个简单的线性分类器应用在新领域。

Result: 在加拿大和墨西哥的电子商务客户服务数据集上的实验表明，与现有SOTA预训练模型相比，该模型的少样本意图检测准确率提高了20-23%。

Conclusion: 针对电子商务客户服务领域，提出了一个扩展现有域特定模型的新模型架构，可以用少量标记样本推广到其他域。

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

Abstract: We introduce MedAgentGYM, the first publicly available training environment
designed to enhance coding-based medical reasoning capabilities in large
language model (LLM) agents. MedAgentGYM comprises 72,413 task instances across
129 categories derived from authentic real-world biomedical scenarios. Tasks
are encapsulated within executable coding environments, each featuring detailed
task descriptions, interactive feedback mechanisms, verifiable ground-truth
annotations, and scalable training trajectory generation. Extensive
benchmarking of over 30 LLMs reveals a notable performance disparity between
commercial API-based models and open-source counterparts. Leveraging
MedAgentGYM, Med-Copilot-7B achieves substantial performance gains through
supervised fine-tuning (+36.44%) and continued reinforcement learning
(+42.47%), emerging as an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative
competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [8] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现人类规模的语言模型对罕见语法现象的形式敏感，但不能正确推断其意义，显示出语言形式和意义上的样本效率不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人类规模预训练数据的语言模型是否能像人类一样，通过普遍的结构推理出罕见的语法现象，并了解其形式和意义。

Method: 设计了一套合成基准，针对英语中罕见的“LET-ALONE”结构的句法和语义特征，对人类规模的变压器语言模型进行了测试。

Result: 发现人类规模的语言模型对形式敏感，但无法正确概括“LET-ALONE”的意义，表现出在语言形式和意义上样本效率的非对称性。

Conclusion: 当前的语言模型在样本效率方面对语言形式和意义存在不对称性，与人类语言学习者相异。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to effectively detect perceived emotions in a text for a specific task in SemEval-2025, using a method that is efficient and easy to implement.

Method: The system uses an ensemble of models to predict emotions without requiring additional model training.

Result: EmoRAG achieves results comparable to the best performing systems in the task.

Conclusion: EmoRAG is a competitive system for emotion detection in text, achieving results comparable to the best systems while being efficient and easy to implement.

Abstract: This paper describes EmoRAG, a system designed to detect perceived emotions
in text for SemEval-2025 Task 11, Subtask A: Multi-label Emotion Detection. We
focus on predicting the perceived emotions of the speaker from a given text
snippet, labeling it with emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise,
and disgust. Our approach does not require additional model training and only
uses an ensemble of models to predict emotions. EmoRAG achieves results
comparable to the best performing systems, while being more efficient,
scalable, and easier to implement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZOES是一种无需任何模式或标注样本的新方法，提升LLMs提取实体结构能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义的实体属性模式或标注数据集，导致不完整的提取结果；ZOES无需任何模式或标注样本。

Method: ZOES通过丰富、优化和统一机制进行实体结构提取。

Result: 实验表明ZOES在三个不同领域中持续增强LLMs的完整实体结构提取能力。

Conclusion: ZOES提升了LLMs在不同领域中提取完整实体结构能力，表明其机制可以提高实体结构发现质量。

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [11] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了水印技术对LLMs的对齐属性影响，提出了AR方法恢复对齐，同时确保水印检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型水印技术对输出质量有明显影响，但对真实、安全和有用性等关键对齐属性的影响尚未充分研究，因此本研究旨在系统分析水印技术对这些属性的影响。

Method: 提出了对齐重采样(AR)推理时间采样方法，通过外部奖励模型恢复对齐，并提供对不同水印方法的实验支持。

Result: 实验结果表明，AR 能够恢复两种水印方法的基准对齐，同时保持水印的强检测能力。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了水印强度与模型对齐之间的关键平衡，并提供了一种简单的推理时间解决方案，在实际中负责地部署带水印的LLM。

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PUGC框架，通过UGC进行偏好学习，提高生成响应的质量及对人类偏好的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法高度依赖人为或高级LLM的整理数据，代价高且难以扩展。

Method: PUGC框架利用未标记的用户生成内容（UGC）的隐含人类偏好生成偏好数据。

Result: 在Alpaca Eval 2实验中，使用DPO和PUGC训练的模型在性能上比传统方法提高9.37%，并创下35.93%的长度控制胜率。

Conclusion: PUGC方法改进了偏好数据的质量，并实现了可扩展的领域特定对齐。

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

*Yue Gong,Chuan Lei,Xiao Qin,Kapil Vaidya,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy,Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLens框架能检测并纠正LLM生成的SQL语句的语义错误，显著提升查询准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在文本到SQL任务上表现出色，但它们生成的SQL查询往往语义上不正确。亟需一个方法提升其语义正确性。

Method: SQLens框架通过将底层数据库和大语言模型的错误信号相结合，识别SQL语句中的潜在语义错误，并指导查询纠正。

Result: 在两个公共基准测试中，SQLens在错误检测F1评分上超出最佳LLM自我评估方法25.78%，并提升了开箱即用文本到SQL系统的执行准确性高达20%。

Conclusion: SQLens显著提高了低技术非专业人士使用SQL查询的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

### [14] [DRE: An Effective Dual-Refined Method for Integrating Small and Large Language Models in Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04516)
*Kun Zhao,Bohao Yang,Chen Tang,Siyuan Dai,Haoteng Tang,Chenghua Lin,Liang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出跨大小语言模型的整合方法SLIDE和改进性DRE，在对话评估中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多义场景中不稳定，而小型语言模型易受误导输入的影响。结合两者的优点以提高对话评估的可靠性。

Method: 引入了SLIDE（Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation），一种通过自适应加权整合SLM和LLM的方法，并进一步提出了双重优化评估（DRE）方法。

Result: 实验表明，DRE方法在各种基准上比现有方法更符合人工判断。

Conclusion: 通过结合小型语言模型和大型语言模型，提出了一种在对话评估中更可靠的方法，特别是在开放任务中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

*Di Wu,Seth Aycock,Christof Monz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 逐步翻译不一定优于直接重新翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在翻译任务中的分解策略是否真正提高了性能。

Method: 通过实证方法测试逐步翻译的有效性，并与直接重新翻译进行对比分析。

Result: 实验结果显示，直接命令LLMs重新翻译比逐步提示产生更好的结果。

Conclusion: 人类式逐步推动可能不是翻译增强的必需条件。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

TL;DR: 研究LLMs对英语“just”多重意义的区分能力，发现其在细微差别的识别上仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型(LLMs)在区分英语“just”细微意义上的能力。

Method: 使用语言学专家精心创建和标记的数据来研究LLMs对“just”不同意义的识别能力。

Result: 发现LLMs在区分较广义类别上有一定能力，但在捕捉更细微差别方面存在困难，表明其在理解话语粒子上的不足。

Conclusion: LLMs具备区分话语粒子广泛类别的能力，但在理解其细微差异上仍需改进。

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

TL;DR: 引入了涵盖13种非洲语言对的SSA-MTE评估数据集，开发SSA-COMET系列评估指标，实验表明新模型在低资源语言上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器翻译质量评估指标在非洲低资源语言上表现不佳，需要新的解决方案来解决评估集规模小、缺乏专门训练数据以及极低资源场景中不一致的性能问题。

Method: 推出SSA-MTE数据集，该数据集包含13种非洲语言对的评估，开发了SSA-COMET和SSA-COMET-QE评估指标，并使用GPT-4o和Claude等先进的LLM对提示方法进行基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示SSA-COMET模型在低资源语言的评估中显著优于AfriCOMET，并与最强的LLM（Gemini 2.5 Pro）相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: SSA-COMET和SSA-COMET-QE模型显著优于现有的AfriCOMET评估方法，并在低资源语言上表现与强大的LLM（如Gemini 2.5 Pro）具有竞争力。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了通过提示操控进行的完整性攻击，揭示多代理系统在面对恶意代理时的脆弱性，以及现有监控机制的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多代理系统（MAS）因其能够在分布式代理中实现合作而受到关注，但对来自多方的攻击仍然脆弱。本研究旨在探索通过细微的提示操控进行完整性攻击的方式，以偏转MAS的操作流程从而使恶意代理获得各种利益。

Method: 研究探讨了恶意代理如何通过细微的提示操控来偏转MAS操作。本研究提出并测试了四种攻击类型：收割者攻击（Scapegoater）、自夸者攻击（Boaster）、自我交易者攻击（Self-Dealer）和搭便车者攻击（Free-Rider）。实验表明，有策略地设计提示可以在MAS行为中引入系统偏差，并误导评估系统，减弱多代理协作。同时，这四种攻击也能够绕过GPT-4o-mini和o3-mini等高级基于LLM的监控器。

Result: 研究表明，有策略性设计的提示可在MAS行为以及可执行指令中引入系统偏差，使恶意代理能够有效误导评估系统并操控协作的代理。测试展示这些攻击可绕过现有的高级监控机制。

Conclusion: 现有检测机制的不足凸显了需要针对多代理系统（MAS）架构设计更具鲁棒性的安全协议和内容验证机制，监控系统也应具备全面的风险场景评估能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

*Dimitris Vamvourellis,Dhagash Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在金融情感分析中，快速直觉的模型表现优于复杂推理模型，说明过度推理可能带来不理想结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在零样本金融情感分析中的表现，分析推理型与非推理型模型的有效性及其与人工标注情感的一致性，尤其在金融高风险应用中的应用潜力。

Method: 采用标注专家注释的Financial PhraseBank数据集，评估几种大语言模型及提示策略在金融情感上的表现，并与微调在金融情感分析的较小模型FinBERT-Prosus和FinBERT-Tone进行对比，模拟快速直觉型及缓慢审慎型思维进行性能测试。

Result: 发现推理并未提高模型在任务中的表现，最准确且与人类一致的组合是GPT-4o而不用链式思考（CoT）提示。

Conclusion: 在零样本金融情感分析中，快速直觉型的“系统1”思维与人类判断更为一致，而并非依赖于推理模型或链式思考（CoT）的慢速、审慎的“系统2”风格。推理并未显著提升任务表现，且可能导致过度思考引发不理想预测结果。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

TL;DR: LLMs难以处理词汇多样化的问题，提出了SCALe基准和MenTaL方法来提升LLMs在翻译多样化文本至统一逻辑符号上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的逻辑推理基准缺乏词汇多样性，掩盖了LLMs作为逻辑翻译器在处理语词多样化方面的不可靠性，需进行改善。

Method: 使用MenTaL方法，在上下文学习和监督微调的帮助下，指导LLMs先构建统一表达形式的表格，然后进行翻译。

Result: 实验表明，新提出的SCALe基准确认了当前LLMs在一致映射多样化表达至统一逻辑符号能力方面的不足。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型在翻译多样化文本至统一逻辑符号方面表现欠佳，提出的方法MenTaL明显改善了翻译性能。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过引入基于梯度匹配的演示选择方法，改进了大型语言模型的多次ICL性能，优于随机选择方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多次ICL演示选择主要依赖于随机选择，这种方法在多次演示场景下不够有效。作者推测ICL的数据需求与微调相似，因此提出了一种新的演示选择方法。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于梯度匹配的方法，通过对比目标任务整个训练集和选择出的示例的微调梯度来选择演示，从而更接近整个训练集的学习效果。

Result: 在从4-shot到128-shot的场景中，新方法在9个不同数据集上均优于随机选择。例如，在Qwen2.5-72B和Llama3-70B上提高了4%，在5个闭源LLM上提高了约2%。

Conclusion: 引入了一种新的梯度匹配方法，以在无需微调的情况下，通过演示选择来增强大型语言模型的快速任务适应能力，提高了许多不同数据集上的性能。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自动事实核查系统有所进步，但基于检索增强型语言模型的事实核查系统仍难以应对故意设计的对抗性声明，这导致了准确性的挑战。

Method: 提出一种无需训练的方法，通过重新措辞原始声明，以便于找到支持证据。使用模块化框架SUCEA，将任务分解为三个步骤：声明分割与去情境化、迭代证据检索与声明编辑、证据汇总与标签预测。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的事实核查数据集上的实验表明，该框架在检索和标签准确率方面显著提高，超越了四个基于声明分解的强基线。

Conclusion: SUCEA框架显著提高了对抗性声明的事实核查系统的检索和标签推理准确性，证明其优于现有的一些强基线模型。

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

TL;DR: 引入MuSciClaims基准测试，发现现有视觉-语言模型在主张验证能力上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的科学问答（QA）、图表标注以及其他多模态推理任务中的基准测试未能直接测试关于主张验证的能力。

Method: 开发了一个名为MuSciClaims的新基准测试，并设计了一系列诊断任务。自动从科学文章中提取支持的主张，并通过手动扰动产生矛盾的主张，以测试主张验证能力。

Result: 大多数视觉-语言模型在验证主张方面表现不佳（F1值约为0.3-0.5），即使是表现最好的模型F1值也仅为0.77。模型倾向于判断主张是支持的，可能误解主张中的细微扰动。

Conclusion: 通过诊断任务发现：模型在从图形中定位正确证据、跨模态信息聚合以及理解图形基本组成部分方面表现不佳。

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

Motivation: 当前自动语音识别（ASR）和自动语音翻译（AST）系统在处理未经监督的数据时，精度和效率存在局限性。大规模语言模型（LLM）具有强大的语言理解能力，可以帮助提高这些系统的性能。

Method: LESS框架通过利用大语言模型（LLMs）对来自野生数据的伪标签进行校正。具体做法是，利用LLM对ASR或AST生成的无监督数据的伪标签文本进行优化，并通过数据过滤策略增强LLM知识传递的效率。

Result: 实验表明，LESS在普通话ASR和西班牙语到英语AST任务中，实现了Wenet Speech测试集绝对错误率减少3.77%，在Callhome和Fisher测试集上的BLEU分数分别为34.0和64.7。

Conclusion: LESS框架在不同语言、任务和领域中表现出较高的适应性，有效提高了伪标签的准确性和模型的翻译性能。

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法如过程奖励模型（PRM）或自一致性，往往作为不透明的系统运行，缺乏可用于验证判断的证据，可能限制其有效性。为此，我们受到数学证明对于支持数学主张的黄金标准这一理念的启发。

Method: 我们提出了一个回顾性的、步骤感知的形式验证框架$Safe$，在每一步推理中使用正式数学语言Lean 4进行数学陈述，并提供正式证明来识别幻觉。通过这种方式，我们避免了使用任意得分的方法，并且能够提供可检查的证据。

Result: 我们的框架$Safe$在多个语言模型和各种数学数据集上进行了评估，显示出显著的性能提升，并提供了解释性和可验证的证据。我们还提出了$FormalStep$，作为通过30,809个正式陈述进行步骤正确性定理证明的基准。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，使用正式数学语言Lean 4来验证LLM生成的自然语言内容可以显著提高性能，并提供可解释和可验证的证据。这项工作展示了正式数学语言在验证过程中的潜力，尤其是在易于产生幻觉的推理任务中。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Conclusion: 引入了一个新的科学自然语言推断评估基准（MISMATCHED），为非计算机科学的三个领域提供了覆盖，并展示了其在预训练的小语言模型和大语言模型上的基线表现。

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: ADAPT improves LLM reasoning by enhancing output diversity, achieving high accuracy with reduced compute in TTS applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the effectiveness of LLMs using Test-Time Scaling (TTS) by addressing the issue of reduced output diversity in reasoning-optimized models.

Method: The paper proposes ADAPT, a method that applies prefix tuning with a diversity-focused data strategy to improve the diversity of outputs from LLMs.

Result: ADAPT achieves 80% accuracy on mathematical reasoning tasks while using eight times less compute compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: ADAPT effectively enhances reasoning performance of LLMs with significantly reduced computational resources, emphasizing the importance of output diversity in TTS.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有创新研究强调社会结构对创新能力的影响，该研究旨在通过机器学习模型探索创新者个人视角和人际创新机会的作用。

Method: 使用动态语言表示，量化创新者在概念空间中的主观视角和创新机会。

Result: 角度差异中的前者（视角）预测创意成就，而后者（背景）则相反，并且与人工智能代理的模拟结果一致。

Conclusion: 个人视角和人际创新机会的量化可预测未来创意的成功与否。

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

### [30] [Static Word Embeddings for Sentence Semantic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04624)
*Takashi Wada,Yuki Hirakawa,Ryotaro Shimizu,Takahiro Kawashima,Yuki Saito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化句子语义表示的新静态词嵌入方法，通过简单平均词嵌入表示句子，在语义任务中优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化静态词嵌入以更好地表示句子语义。

Method: 我们从预训练的句子变换器中提取词嵌入，并通过句子级的主成分分析进行改进，随后采用知识蒸馏或对比学习。在推理期间，通过简单平均词嵌入来表示句子。

Result: 模型在单语和跨语言任务中表现优异，能够成功去除与句子语义无关的词嵌入成分，并根据词对句子语义的影响调节向量范数。

Conclusion: 我们的模型在句子语义任务上显著优于现有的静态模型，并在某些数据集上甚至可以媲美基本的句子变换模型（SimCSE）。

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

*Zhiyuan Ma,Jiayu Liu,Xianzhen Luo,Zhenya Huang,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tool-MVR, a Tool-Augmented LLM, addresses tool planning and reflection limits of current models, surpassing ToolLLM and GPT-4 on benchmarks and reducing API errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle with unreliable tool planning due to poor datasets and have weak tool reflection abilities. There is a need to improve tool utilization capabilities to enable AI agents to solve complex problems effectively.

Method: The paper introduces two innovations: Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV) to create a high-quality instruction dataset called ToolBench-V, and Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE) for enhancing tool reflection, producing a reflection dataset called ToolBench-R.

Result: Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, improving over ToolLLM by 23.9% and GPT-4 by 15.3%, reducing API calls by 31.4% and demonstrating strong generalization across unseen tools. On RefineToolBench, it has a 58.9% error correction rate versus ToolLLM's 9.1%.

Conclusion: Tool-MVR significantly outperforms existing models like ToolLLM and GPT-4 in tool utilization and reflection capabilities, reducing errors and API calls.

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过改进自动化数据收集方法实现更高效的AVSR数据集生成，并在越南语中验证其有效性，实验中表明在噪声环境中实现了更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AVSR在处理噪声方面具有显著优势，但缺乏大型数据集，尤其是英语之外的语言。自动数据收集可能是一个解决方案。

Method: 通过自动化的数据收集方法，从原始视频中生成AVSR数据集，并开发了一个越南语的AVSR基线模型。

Result: 实验表明，自动收集的数据集能够实现强大的基线，在干净环境中与鲁棒的ASR相比具有竞争力，并在嘈杂环境中显著优于它们。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了一种从原始视频生成音频视觉语音识别(AVSR)数据集的实用方法，大大提高了效率和可访问性。通过自动数据收集，能够扩展AVSR到更多语言，尤其是资源匮乏的语言。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

*Vinay Joshi,Pratik Prabhanjan Brahma,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TaDA的KV缓存压缩方案，不需要管理异常值，显著减少内存占用，提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存在变压器模型中是高效解码和推理的关键组件，但其内存需求随着序列长度扩大呈现不良的比例，对大规模语言模型的可扩展部署构成重大挑战。

Method: 介绍TaDA，一种无训练的KV缓存压缩方法，量化精度适应层间错误敏感性，并通过均值中心化消除对异常值单独处理的需求。

Result: 实验表明，该技术将KV缓存内存占用减少到原始16位基线的27%，同时实现了可比较的准确性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了TaDA，一种无需训练的KV缓存压缩方案，通过量化精度适应层间误差敏感性，并采用均值中心化，消除了对异常值单独处理的需要。该方法在支持不同上下文长度的多个模型中显著提升了准确性。

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

*Juhyun Oh,Eunsu Kim,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 引入Flex-TravelPlanner基准评估语言模型在动态规划中的适应能力，发现现有模型在多回合适应和优先排序上存在明显不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的评估基准主要集中在静态、单回合场景中，忽略了真实规划问题中对动态适应和约束平衡的需求，因此需要一个新的基准来评估语言模型在动态情景中的灵活推理能力。

Method: 通过构建Flex-TravelPlanner基准，研究在多回合中顺序引入约束以及明确优先次序竞争的情景下模型的适应能力。

Result: 分析GPT-4o和Llama 3.1 70B模型，发现单回合任务的表现不能有效预测跨多回合适应计划的能力；约束引入顺序对性能有显著影响；在优先次序把控上，模型往往错误地优先考虑新引入的低优先级偏好。

Conclusion: 研究表明，现有模型在动态规划任务中表现不佳，尤其是在顺序约束引入和优先次序把控方面存在明显挑战，强调了在更现实的动态规划场景中评估语言模型的重要性。

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 当前的LLMs对齐策略不足以防止误用，因其缺乏解决规范冲突的深层能力。这影响了AI的安全部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs的价值对齐问题，着重指出现有对齐策略无法有效防止其被错误使用。

Method: 利用人类偏好进行精调以灌输规范，比如有帮助、诚实和无害等，但这些方法尚未解决LLMs对规范冲突的脆弱性问题。

Result: 研究结果表明，即使是专注于推理的新型LLMs也未解决其对规范冲突的脆弱性，这种"浅层对齐"问题对AI安全和监管有重要影响。

Conclusion: 当前的对齐策略对防止LLMs的误用是根本不足的，因为它们只是强化了浅层的行为倾向，没有赋予LLMs真正的规范性推理能力。

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

TL;DR: 通过REWIRE方法将被丢弃的低质量网络文本改写后用于大语言模型的训练，取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算能力的增长，优质自然语言数据的增长速度无法跟上预训练需求，因此需要改革目前的数据获取和使用方式。

Method: 提出新方法REWIRE，以指导重写的方式改善低质量文件，使其能够用于模型训练。

Result: 在DCLM基准测试中，与仅使用过滤后的网络数据相比，混合高质量原始文本和重写文本的方式使训练在22个任务中分别提高了1.0、1.3和2.5百分点。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，REWIRE方法通过改善低质量文本后，可以有效提升语言模型的训练性能，甚至超越了使用双倍高质量数据的效果。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 为改善隐性仇恨言论检测，引入新分类法及编码策略，显著提高了不同语言数据集的检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络充斥着仇恨言论（HS），威胁社会和谐和个人福祉。现有的自动检测方法在识别显性仇恨言论（ex-HS）方面表现良好，但在识别更隐蔽的隐性仇恨言论（im-HS）时却存在困难。

Method: 引入一种新的分类法用于im-HS检测，定义了六种编码策略称为编码类型（codetypes）。提出两种将编码类型整合到im-HS检测中的方法：1）直接提示大型语言模型（LLMs）通过生成的响应分类句子；2）在编码过程中将编码类型嵌入，使用LLMs作为编码器。

Result: 实验显示，使用编码类型能提升中文和英文数据集上im-HS检测的效果，验证了我们方法在不同语言中的有效性。

Conclusion: 引入新分类法和编码策略显着提高了隐性仇恨言论的检测效果。

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

Method: 引入了一种专门为人文和社会科学领域设计的基准，采用新颖的数据生成流程，由领域专家和自动化代理共同生成并逐步完善样本。

Result: 在HSSBench上，对20多种主流模型进行了基准测试，结果证明即使是最先进的模型也面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: HSSBench对主流的多模态大语言模型构成了重大挑战，期望推动更多关于增强模型跨学科推理能力的研究。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

Motivation: 解决基于N的抽样和树搜索的性能与效率之间的关键权衡问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的模型无关推测解码方法，称为STAND，通过记忆高效的基于logit的N元模块结合优化的Gumbel-Top-K采样和数据驱动的树构建，提高了令牌接受率。

Result: 在多种模型和推理任务上进行的广泛评估表明，与标准自回归解码相比，STAND减少了60-65%的推理延迟，同时保持了准确性。在吞吐量上，STAND优于最新的推测解码方法14-28%。

Conclusion: STAND通过利用推理路径的冗余性，实现了在不影响准确性的情况下显著加速推理过程。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT算法通过多模型竞争与评估提升模型性能，在多项任务上取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了弥补单一模型在生成多样性和评估偏见上的不足，设计多模型组成的竞争体系，以相互竞争和评估的方式实现更优的模型对齐。

Method: 该算法通过让多个大语言模型(LLMs)之间进行竞争和评估，在竞争中相互学习，从而实现集体对齐。每轮选择一个指令和两个模型进行对决，其他模型评估对决结果，并通过适应的elo排名声誉系统聚合结果，胜方加权增加，败方减权。以对决结果形成的偏好对模型进行学习。

Result: 经过大量实验，SPARTA ALIGNMENT在12个任务和数据集中的10个上超过了初始模型和4种自我对齐基线，平均提升7.0%。

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT提高模型的性能，尤其在处理未见过的任务时，并产生更具逻辑性和信息量的输出。

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

Method: 提出了一种新的连续协作突发假新闻检测（C$^2$EFND）框架，通过多轮协同学习框架，结合LLMs的泛化能力和SLMs的分类专长，以及混合专家架构的终身知识编辑模块和基于重播的持续学习方法。

Result: 在Pheme和Twitter16数据集上的广泛实验显示，C$^2$EFND显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: C$^2$EFND框架在连续突发假新闻场景中显著提高了检测准确性和适应性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

*Léane Jourdan,Florian Boudin,Richard Dufour,Nicolas Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了传统评估指标的局限性，并提出结合LLM评估与任务特定指标的混合方法以更好评估科学写作中的文本修订。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指标如ROUGE和BERTScore主要关注相似性，而未能捕捉有意义的改进，因此需要探索更符合人工判断的替代评估方法。

Method: 进行人工标注研究以评估不同修订的质量，调查来自相关NLP领域的无参考评估指标，检验"LLM作为评估者"的方法，即分析大语言模型在有无金标准参考情况下的评估能力。

Result: 结果显示，大语言模型能够有效评估指令遵循但在正确性上有困难，而领域特定指标提供了补充见解。

Conclusion: 结合LLM判断和任务特定指标的混合方法提供了对修订质量的最可靠评估。

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

*Jingyu Hu,Mengyue Yang,Mengnan Du,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过多维度政治框架和可解释表示技术来分析LLM的政治概念，实验显示该方法能有效解开政治概念混淆，并干预生成不同政治倾向的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现LLM的响应与其内部意图之间存在不一致，且大多数研究依赖单轴概念，这可能导致概念混淆。因此，本研究旨在探究LLM的内部机制，以揭示其内部政治状态，并通过多维度扩展和可解释表示技术改进对LLM政治概念的学习。

Method: 研究设计了一个四维政治学习框架，并构建了相应的数据集，用于精细化政治概念向量学习。这些向量可用于检测和干涉LLM的内部机制。在八个开源LLM上进行了实验，采用了三种表示工程技术。

Result: 实验结果显示，这些向量能够解开政治概念混淆。在检测任务中，向量的语义意义得到了验证，并在OOD设置中表现出良好的泛化能力和稳健性。在干涉实验中，向量能够干预LLM以生成具有不同政治倾向的响应。

Conclusion: 通过多维度政治学习框架和可解释表示技术，研究能够更透明地检测和干涉LLM的政治概念状态，并且实验表明这种方法在概念区分、泛化和干预上表现良好。

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

TL;DR: 引入MMSU基准以评估口语理解，通过评估14种SpeechLLMs，发现改进空间，并为人机语音交互系统发展提供见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实世界的口语语言理解中，需要整合语义意义、副语言特征和音韵特征，而目前的SpeechLLMs在自然语音中的细粒度感知和复杂推理能力仍然没有得到充分探索。

Method: 引入了一种名为MMSU的基准，该基准专门设计用于理解和推理口语。它包含5000个精心策划的音频-问题-答案三元组，并系统纳入了包括语音学、韵律学、修辞学、句法学、语义学和副语言学在内的广泛语言现象。通过对14种先进的SpeechLLMs进行严格评估，发现现有模型有很大改进空间。

Result: 通过严格评估14种先进的SpeechLLMs，发现现有模型的效果仍有很大提升空间，指出了未来优化的方向。

Conclusion: MMSU为口语理解的全面评估建立了新的标准，并为开发更复杂的人机语音交互系统提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型整合缺乏系统性的理解和分类方法。本文旨在通过提供一个分类框架来填补现有文献中的这一显著空白，帮助研究人员更好地理解模态整合技术。

Method: 本文采用了一种LLM为中心的分析方法，调查了将不同模态输入转化和对齐至语言嵌入空间的现有方法，并提出了一个基于三维分类框架来对MM模型进行梳理。

Result: 通过对2021至2025年间开发的125个MM模型的研究，识别出该领域的新兴模式，并提供了一个分类框架，从架构策略、表示学习技术和训练范式三方面详细分析了模态整合技术。

Conclusion: 本研究通过对2021至2025年间开发的125个MM模型进行分析，为研究人员提供了当前整合技术结构化的概述。这些见解旨在为未来基于预训练模型的多模态整合策略开发提供指导。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出FineLogic框架，评估逻辑推理的准确性、健全性和对齐性，同时比较不同监督风格对推理能力的影响，发现自然语言监督具有强泛化能力，而符号推理有助于结构化推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的逻辑推理基准仅关注最终答案的准确性，而未能捕捉推理过程的质量和结构。为了更全面地评估LLMs的逻辑推理能力，有必要设计一个更精细的评估框架。

Method: 引入FineLogic评价框架，从整体基准准确性、逐步推理健全性和表示级别对齐三个方面评估逻辑推理。并通过构建四种监督风格（包含一种自然语言和三种符号变体）对模型进行微调训练，以研究监督格式对推理能力的影响。

Result: 自然语言监督能够在分布外和长上下文任务中表现出强大的泛化能力，而符号推理风格更促进结构上健全和原子的推理链。表示级别探测表明，微调主要通过逐步生成来改善推理行为，而不是通过增强捷径预测或内化正确性来实现。

Conclusion: FineLogic框架和分析方法提供了一种评估和改进LLMs逻辑推理能力的更严谨和可解释的视角。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合CNN和BERT的新型混合方法用于机器翻译校对，成功识别并纠正翻译错误，性能优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自动翻译可能出现错误，需大量人力后期编辑，因此机器翻译校对对于提高质量至关重要。

Method: 本文提出了一种结合卷积神经网络（CNN）与双向编码器表示（BERT）的新型混合方法进行强大的校对。使用CNN提取短语和表达中的语义信息，并利用BERT的注意力机制进行错误检测，以修正翻译中的不规则性。校正模块结合平行英德对齐和GRU解码器模型以及翻译记忆来提出修改建议。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在多个指标上的表现超越了近期的校对技术，并在多领域的大规模平行语料库上展现出色的校对性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的混合方法超越了现有校对技术，取得了90%的准确率，89.37%的F1分数和16.24%的均方误差，表明其在识别和纠正错误翻译和遗漏方面的先进性能。

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了VLM和LLM在印尼学校课堂中对学生手写答卷的评阅效能，发现VLM识别学生手写答卷存在困难导致错误传播，但LLM生成的反馈仍有实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视力-语言模型（VLM）和大型语言模型（LLM）在教育评估中提供了有前景的机会，但其在实际课堂环境，尤其是在代表性不足的教育背景中的有效性尚未得到充分探讨。

Method: 研究评估了一个先进的VLM和几个LLM在印尼六所学校的646份四年级手写考试答卷上的表现，包括数学和英语两门学科，任务包括评阅这些答卷并生成个性化反馈。

Result: VLM在准确识别学生手写答卷方面存在困难，导致在后续的LLM评分中出现错误传播。然而，即便输入存在不完美，LLM生成的反馈依然保持了一定的实用性，但个性化和上下文相关性仍存在局限性。

Conclusion: VLM在识别学生手写文字时存在困难，导致后续LLM评估中出现错误传递。然而，即使输入不完美，LLM生成的反馈仍具有一定实用价值，但在个性化和语境相关性方面仍有局限。

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受全球报纸每日发布的新测试集挑战，旨在解决隐晦填字游戏线索的语言任务。

Method: 构建一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的推理系统，通过假设答案、提出文字游戏解释并使用验证系统进行推导，以解决隐晦填字游戏线索。

Result: 在具有挑战性的Cryptonite数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，这些数据集来自英国《泰晤士报》和《每日电讯报》。证明的解决方案以Python表达，使可解释的文字游戏推理可供检查。

Conclusion: 该系统在解答隐晦填字游戏线索方面表现卓越，提供了可解释的推理过程。

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有的幻觉检测方法主要专注于答案级别的不确定性，但对于 LRMs 因其推理轨迹的潜在幻觉和逻辑不一致性检测不足。为解决该问题，提出了针对 LRMs 的专用框架 RACE。

Method: 本文提出了 RACE 框架，该框架通过提取关键的推理步骤，并计算四个诊断信号：推理轨迹的样本间一致性、基于熵的答案不确定性、推理与答案之间的语义一致性以及推理的内部连贯性。

Result: 实验表明，RACE 在不同数据集和不同大型语言模型中均能超越现有幻觉检测基线。

Conclusion: RACE 优于现有的幻觉检测基线，为评估大型推理模型（LRMs）提供了一种稳健且可推广的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

Conclusion: 研究为社区提供了一个新的学生同声传译数据集及相关工具，有助于同声传译任务的自动化理解与再现。

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

Motivation: 人工智能在教育领域的应用为学生和教育工作者带来了新的学习方法，尤其是大语言模型在生成教育材料和问答方面的潜力。然而，生成多项选择题过程繁复，而LLM提供了解决这一难题的希望。

Method: 对三种著名的LLM（Llama 2、Mistral和GPT-3.5）进行对比分析，不依赖LLM的知识，而是通过提示注入知识，以减少虚假信息，并让教育者控制测试的来源文本。

Result: 实验表明，GPT-3.5在多个已知指标上生成的多项选择题最为有效。

Conclusion: GPT-3.5在生成多项选择题方面表现最佳，尽管教育领域对采用AI仍有一些保留。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

Motivation: 研究等距机器翻译在多语言对下的效果，希望通过优化长度和质量权衡，实现更高性能的处理。

Method: 使用不同提示策略、不同数量的少示例，以及演示选择来探讨翻译质量和长度控制。

Result: 发现说明的措辞对控制输出长度至关重要；少示例提示普遍提高翻译质量，但改善幅度有限；考虑多个输出可以显著改善长度与质量之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 在不仅关注翻译质量的同时，也关注输出长度控制，由于极端示例或等距示例的影响，模型在长度约束上的表现不同。考虑多个输出能够显著改善长度与质量之间的权衡，为某些语言对提供了最先进的性能。

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Motivation: 鉴于Universal Dependencies在跨语言句法表示中的成功，探讨其有效性并评估其能否提升预训练语言模型的表现。

Method: 将Universal Dependencies整合到预训练语言模型中，并在跨语言对抗性释义识别任务上进行评估。

Result: 在准确率和F1分数上分别平均提升了3.85%和6.08%，并在某些语言对中缩小了与大型语言模型的性能差距。

Conclusion: 结合UD能够显著提高跨语言对抗性释义识别任务中的表现，并有潜力缩小预训练模型与大语言模型在某些语言对中的差距。

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

Motivation: 现有的评估标准无法准确反映大规模语言模型在真实竞赛环境中的编程能力，尤其是其反思能力。

Method: 提出ICPC-Eval，这是一个顶级竞争性编码基准，包含来自全球11个地区的118个ICPC竞赛题目，并提供测试用例生成方法和本地评估工具包，以及新的评估指标Refine@K。

Result: 结果表明，大规模推理模型仍需要依赖多轮代码反馈来发挥其全部潜力，与顶尖人类团队相比，模型在代码生成方面尚有差距。

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval能够有效评估复杂推理能力，但当前的大语言模型与人类顶尖团队比仍有差距。

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Verbose ListOps 是一种新基准测试，旨在揭示 LLMs 在嵌套推理上表现不佳的缺陷，尽管在长上下文中，提高推理能力对于真实世界的文本解读至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长上下文和多跳问答基准测试无法有效测试 LLMs 的嵌套叙述推理能力，缺乏真实的干扰因素或未能将上下文长度与推理复杂性分开，掩盖了 LLM 的一个基本缺陷。为此，研究者提出 Verbose ListOps 作为新的基准测试。

Method: 提出了一种名为 Verbose ListOps 的新型基准测试，通过编程方式将 ListOps 计算转化为长而连贯的故事，阻止中间结果来迫使 LLMs 管理状态和进行内部计算。

Result: 实验表明，领先的 LLMs（如 OpenAI o4 和 Gemini 2.5 Pro）在 Verbose ListOps 上表现糟糕，即使在适度的长度下（约 1 万个 token）也无法保持性能，而在解决原始的 ListOps 方程时毫不费力。

Conclusion: 在真实世界的文本解释中，识别关键推理点、跟踪概念中间结果和过滤无关信息至关重要。Verbose ListOps 提供了一种扩展的生成框架，能够实现针对性的推理增强，超越了单纯的上下文窗口扩展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

Motivation: 挑战普遍认为微调现有多语言E2E模型对低资源语言效果最佳的信念。

Method: 采用混合HMM与自监督学习模型结合的方法，继续进行自监督的预训练和半监督训练。

Result: 在Scottish Gaelic语言上，通过该方法实现了相对于最好的微调Whisper模型WER减少32%。

Conclusion: 将混合HMM与自监督模型相结合的方法可以在训练数据有限的情况下取得显著更好的性能。

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在生成英语的建构性反馈和教学提示方面表现出能力，但其在不同语言，特别是数学推理任务中的有效性尚未被充分研究。

Method: 采用大规模的多语言教师-学生互动模拟，其中较强大的模型作为教师生成提示形式的反馈，一个较弱的模型模拟学生。这项研究探索了11种语言的352种实验设置，使用了四个最先进的LLM以及多种提示策略。

Result: 当反馈与学生的母语一致时，多语言提示显著提高了学习成果，尤其是在低资源语言中。

Conclusion: 这项研究的结果表明，多语言提示显著改善了学习成果，尤其是在反馈与学生母语对齐的情况下低资源语言中表现尤为明显。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Motivation: 解决NMT在处理词汇歧义和上下文方面的困境，尤其是在领域特定的应用中如电商数据中不清晰的句子和数据质量差的问题。

Method: 创建了一个新的捷克语到波兰语电子商务产品翻译数据集，并测试了多种上下文感知翻译的方法，其中包括使用视觉语言模型和在文本模型中加入上下文信息。

Result: 研究结果表明，加入上下文信息能够提高机器翻译的质量。

Conclusion: 通过加入上下文信息，能够有效提高机器翻译质量。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

Motivation: 为了在标注数据稀缺的情况下对预训练ASR模型进行领域特定的微调，利用无标记音频数据和相关领域的标注数据。

Method: 提出了增量半监督学习管道。首先整合小规模的域内标注集和来自密切相关领域的辅助数据集，然后通过多模型一致性或命名实体识别进行伪标签筛选并迭代优化。

Result: 在Wow呼叫中心和Fisher English语料库上进行评估，新方法优于单步微调。共识滤波方法在Wow上提供了高达22.3%的相对改进，在Fisher上提升了24.8%。

Conclusion: 增量半监督学习管道在特定领域的ASR模型微调中表现优异，尤其当标签数据稀缺时。通过使用多模型一致性或命名实体识别进行伪标签筛选，可以显著提升性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们担心大型语言模型（LLMs）的理解过程是否与专家一致，因此难以依赖其应用于实际场景。

Method: 提出SCOP方法，从认知视角分析LLMs的理解过程，定义五种必要技能，构建测试数据并对开源和闭源LLMs进行详细分析。

Result: 发现LLMs在专家级理解上仍存在挑战，但在处理局部信息上表现较好。同时，LLMs可能通过不完善的理解过程得到正确答案，显示其不可靠性。

Conclusion: 建议提升LLMs理解能力的方向应聚焦在全面发展理解技能，确保训练中所有技能的完善。

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

Motivation: 现有方法通常需要复杂的模型改造，限制了与预训练模型的兼容性。因此，需要一种简单的方法来控制自动文本摘要的生成长度。

Method: 通过在交叉熵损失计算中增加正确预测EOS标记的重要性，提出了一种控制自动文本摘要生成长度的方法。

Result: 在编码器-解码器和现代GPT风格的大型语言模型（LLMs）上进行测试，结果表明该方法能有效控制生成长度，经常不影响摘要质量。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种简单的方法，通过在交叉熵损失计算中增加正确预测EOS标记的重要性，来控制自动文本摘要的生成长度。该方法与架构和解码算法无关，并且在不影响摘要质量的情况下，实现了对生成长度的控制。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

Conclusion: AR-Checker 在数学任务和超出数学领域的基准测试中均取得强劲性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

Method: 利用包含600多篇经过详细注释的辩论演讲的数据集，对LLM与人类评判在这个任务上的表现进行深入分析。

Result: 较大的模型在某些方面能够接近个别人的判断，但在整体判断行为上与人类有很大不同。前沿的LLM在生成有说服力的、带有观点的演讲时，可能达到人类水平。

Conclusion: LLM在评估辩论演讲时展现了特定的认知能力，与人类评判者相比有细微的差别。

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

Motivation: 研究如何解释LLM生成的自我报告，因为这些LLM表现出日益增长的语言流畅性和认知能力。

Method: 本文通过呈现并批评两个来自LLM的明显自省的自我报告案例，分析其合理性。

Result: 研究表明，LLM在描述自己“创造性”写作过程时未表现出有效的自省，而在推断自身温度参数时可以被视为最小程度的自省。

Conclusion: 文章指出大语言模型的自我报告能否被视为一种自省，一些报告可能不具有有效的自省特性，而另一些则可以被视为最小程度的自省示例。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

Motivation: 在应用RLHF进行字幕翻译时表现不佳，尤其是对口语化字幕翻译的表现，探究其原因并改进该方法。

Method: 提出了一种对抗训练框架RIVAL，把翻译过程看作是RM和LLM之间的一个最小-最大博弈。框架通过不断迭代更新两个模型，RM负责区分强与弱翻译并给予质量偏好奖励，而LLM则加强其翻译能力以减少这种差距。加入定量偏好奖励以稳定训练和提高泛化能力。

Result: 通过大量实验表明，所提出的对抗训练框架显著提升了翻译基线的表现。

Conclusion: RIVAL通过结合质量偏好奖励和定量偏好奖励改进了字幕翻译任务中LLM的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

TL;DR: 研究利用AI模型分析哈尔滨街道特征对社区商业活力的影响，发现适度车辆增加商业访问性，过量停车降低满意度且影响定价，而绿化和清洁度提高满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社区规模街道上商业活力的影响因素，为城市设计、停车管理和社区振兴规划工具提供参考。

Method: 使用街景图像和多模态大型语言模型（VisualGLM-6B），从美团和点评数据构建社区商业活力指数（CCVI），并分析其与通过GPT-4感知模型提取的空间属性的关系。

Result: 适度的车辆存在可能提高商业访问，但过量的街边停车尤其在狭窄街道上会降低步行性和用户满意度及商店定价。而街道绿化和清洁度较高时满意度得分明显增加，但与定价关系弱。

Conclusion: 通过结合AI辅助的感知与城市形态分析，研究展示了街道特征如停车密度、绿化程度、清洁度和街道宽度对商业表现和用户满意度的影响。

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

Motivation: 社交媒体上的误导性文本可能导致公共误解、社会恐慌甚至经济损失，因此在这些平台上进行误导性文本检测是一个关键的研究领域。

Method: 提出一个名为CL-ISR的框架，结合对比学习和隐性立场推理。首先利用对比学习算法提高模型对真实和误导性文本语义差异的学习能力，然后引入隐性立场推理模块来探究文本中的潜在立场倾向及其与相关话题的联系。

Result: 通过将对比学习和隐性立场推理结合，CL-ISR框架显著改善了误导性文本的检测效果。

Conclusion: 通过结合对比学习和隐性立场推理，CL-ISR框架在提高社交媒体上误导性文本检测的准确性方面展现了显著的效果。

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

Motivation: 现有使用BERT和wav2vec 2.0进行口语评估的研究各有不足，需要新的方法来综合这两种模型的优点，提高口语能力评估的准确性。

Method: 提出一个系统，通过分数融合策略将wav2vec 2.0与Phi-4多模态大型语言模型整合。

Result: 在Speak & Improve Challenge 2025的官方测试集上达到0.375的均方根误差（RMSE），在比赛中排名第二。

Conclusion: 整合W2V与Phi-4 MLLM的系统在口语评估中表现优异，解决了现有模型的个别局限性。

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DiCoRe框架，通过Dreamer和Grounder模块，提升了零样本事件检测任务的性能，实现了显著的F1提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于在专业领域中文档理解的重要性，需要克服复杂事件本体、从文本中提取领域特定触发器、并恰当构建它们给大型语言模型带来的负担和限制，从而提升大型语言模型在零样本事件检测任务中的效用。

Method: 提出了一种称为DiCoRe的发散-汇聚推理框架，通过Dreamer和Grounder模块解耦事件检测任务。其中，Dreamer通过开放式事件发现鼓励发散性推理，增强事件覆盖率；而Grounder则引入汇聚推理，通过有限状态机引导的约束解码将自由形式的预测与任务特定指令对齐。最后，LLM-Judge模块验证最终输出以确保高精度。

Result: 通过在五个领域的六个数据集和九个大型语言模型上进行大量实验，DiCoRe始终优于之前的零样本、迁移学习和推理基线，在最佳基线基础上实现了4-7%的平均F1增益。

Conclusion: DiCoRe在零样本事件检测任务中展现出优异性能，与现有方法相比，实现了4-7%的平均F1提升，确立了其作为强大零样本事件检测框架的地位。

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

Motivation: 探讨神经语言模型的归纳偏差是否与人类处理约束一致或不同。

Method: 提出了一种量化框架，引入$m$局部熵作为信息理论度量，通过平均有损上下文惊讶度来捕捉语言的局部不确定性。

Result: 实验结果表明具有较高$m$局部熵的语言对于Transformer和LSTM语言模型更难学习。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型与人类一样，对语言的局部统计结构非常敏感。

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

Motivation: 理解大型音频语言模型的内部机制对于解释其行为和提高性能至关重要。

Method: 通过在三个最先进的LALMs上应用词汇投影，研究跟踪属性信息如何在层和标记位置之间演变，以及分析LALMs是如何依赖于查询音频输入来预测属性的。

Result: 研究表明，当识别失败时，属性信息随着层深度的增加而通常减少，而在早期层准确解决属性与更高的准确性相关联。此外，LALMs在预测属性时，严重依赖于查询听觉输入，而非在隐藏状态下聚合必要的信息。基于这些发现，研究提出了一种增强LALMs的方法。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了关于大型音频语言模型（LALMs）在内部如何感知和识别听觉属性的深入分析，揭示了属性信息在层和标记位置之间的演变规律。研究发现，在识别失败的情况下，随着层次深度的增加，属性信息通常会减少，而在较早的层次解决属性与更高的准确性相关联。

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

*Diege Sun,Guanyi Chen,Fan Zhao,Xiaorong Cheng,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how well LLMs replicate human error assessments in text/image contexts, finding limited alignment, with notable exceptions like DeepSeek-V3 performing well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can replicate human judgments on error severity in natural language generation, especially with different error types and in both text-only and text + image contexts.

Method: The study compared human and LLM assessments of controlled semantic errors in image descriptions across unimodal and multimodal settings, focusing on error types like age, gender, clothing type, and clothing color.

Result: Humans assign different severity levels to error types, with visual context increasing severity perception for some. Most LLMs deviate from human judgments, especially on gender and color errors, except for Doubao and notably DeepSeek-V3, which aligned closely with human judgment across conditions.

Conclusion: LLMs currently do not fully replicate human assessments of error severity in language generation, particularly regarding gender and color errors due to differences in perceptual and social norm grounding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统过于依赖检索上下文，导致在处理误导性或过量信息时忽略模型固有知识。为解决这种不平衡，提出Knowledgeable-r1。

Method: 提出Knowledgeable-r1，使用联合采样和定义多策略分布，以促进大语言模型的参数知识和上下文知识的自我整合利用。

Result: Knowledgeable-r1显著提高了知识能力探索的鲁棒性和推理准确性，并在反事实场景中比基线高17.07%。

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1通过联合采样和定义多策略分布来刺激大语言模型自我整合参数和上下文知识，显著增强了模型在参数和上下文冲突任务上的稳健性和推理准确性，在RAG任务中取得了持续的提升，尤其在反事实情景中，基线提升了17.07%。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

TL;DR: 研究揭示LLMs中的偏见多集中于某些层中，移除偏见组件会减小偏见但影响其他任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型(LLMs)展现出明显的社会、人口及性别偏见，很多是由于其训练数据所致。研究这种偏见的结构性表征至关重要。

Method: 采用一个机械可解释性的方法，分析模型如GPT-2和Llama2内偏见的结构性表示。通过不同指标识别导致偏见行为的内部边界，并通过系统削减法来研究这些与偏见相关的计算的稳定性、定位性和可推广性。

Result: 偏见相关的计算高度局限，通常集中在少量层中；这些组件在不同的微调设置中会发生变化，移除这些组件可以减少偏见输出，但也会影响其他NLP任务，因为这些任务可能会共享重要组件。

Conclusion: 在大型语言模型中，偏见是高度局限化且可以定位的，尽管消除这些偏见组件会对其他NLP任务产生影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

Motivation: 先前的压缩方法未能有效滤除非证据性信息，限制了基于LLM的RAG性能。因此需要一种新的方法来提高这种性能表现。

Method: ECoRAG通过一种名为证据性指导的RAG框架，通过压缩文档来去除非证据性信息，并在必要时检索更多内容以确保充分证据性，从而提升LLM性能。

Result: 实验表明，ECoRAG在ODQA任务上提高了LLM性能，优于现有的压缩方法。此外，ECoRAG不仅减少延迟时间，同时通过保留必要信息来生成正确答案，最大限度地减少了token使用，具有很高的性价比。

Conclusion: ECoRAG框架通过根据证据性压缩检索到的文档，确保答案生成得到正确证据支持，从而提高LLM在ODQA任务中的性能，并且其性能优于现有的压缩方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

TL;DR: 提出RELIC框架评估LLM指令跟随，在复杂语法上表现不佳，表现与理论预期一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无输入输出示例的情况下，通过给定的任务规范评估LLM的指令跟随能力。

Method: 引入RELIC框架，通过语言识别任务来评估LLM的指令跟随能力。该任务需要组合大量从上下文中检索到的指令（语法生成规则）。

Result: 评估表明，LLM的准确性与语法的复杂性和示例字符串的个体特征有关。在更复杂的语法和样本上，表现趋近于偶然水平。

Conclusion: 即使是最先进的LLM在处理复杂语法和样本时，其表现接近于偶然水平，符合理论预期。随着任务复杂性的增加，模型更倾向于使用浅层启发式方法，而不是遵循复杂的指令。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex

TL;DR: 研究者发布了一个8TB的公开授权文本数据集Common Pile v0.1，训练了两个7B参数的LLM，表现与使用未授权文本训练的模型相竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型通常使用未授权文本进行训练，这种做法因可能存在知识产权侵权和伦理问题而受到审查。使用公开授权文本进行训练是解决这些问题的一步，但之前的数据收集工作所产生的数据集通常规模太小或质量太低，不能用于生成高性能LLM。

Method: 收集、整理并发布Common Pile v0.1，这是一个包含八个字节的公开授权文本集合，用于LLM预训练。且通过训练两个7B参数的LLM进行了性能验证。

Result: 训练的两个7B参数的LLM在性能上与使用无授权文本训练的LLM相媲美，例如Llama 1 和2。这些模型是在1万亿和2万亿标记上进行训练的。

Conclusion: Common Pile v0.1提供了一个公开授权的文本数据集，可以用来训练LLMs，并在性能上与使用无授权文本训练的LLMs相竞争。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

### [87] [Improving Low-Resource Morphological Inflection via Self-Supervised Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05227)
*Adam Wiemerslage,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究自监督任务在极低资源字符级任务中的效果，发现自动编码在数据有限时表现最佳，而字符掩码语言模型在数据增加时更有效，基于词素边界的遮罩采样能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自监督目标在NLP中取得了重大进展，但对于许多语言字符级任务的探索不够，而少量数据在这些任务中可能有益。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器Transformer模型针对19种语言和13种辅助目标进行训练，探索自监督辅助任务在极低资源形态变化任务中的有效性。

Result: 在没有标签的数据非常有限的情况下，自动编码显示了最佳性能；而随着数据量的增加，字符掩码语言模型（CMLM）变得更有效。然而，具有更强归纳偏差的目标虽然能直观地影响模型预测，但很少能超越标准CMLM。

Conclusion: 在极低资源环境下，自监督辅助任务对形态变化的效果显著，其中采样基于已知词素边界的遮罩可以始终提升性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种结合三种语法形式的统一系统分析语言中的连续和不连续结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，语法理论中的各种形式主义独立处理不连续结构的问题，缺乏一种统一而融合的分析系统。作者希望通过整合三种常见语法形式，提供一种统一的表示方法，同时处理语言中的连续和不连续结构。

Method: 采用短语结构语法、依存语法和范畴语法三种语法形式，通过数学推导方法，建立一种统一的表示系统来分析不连续和连续的语言结构。

Result: 提供了一种新的数学推导方法，展示了如何统一分析语言中的连续和不连续结构，并成功结合了三种语法形式的表示。

Conclusion: 本文提出一种统一的语言表示系统，可以处理自然语言中的连续和非连续结构。通过结合短语结构语法（PSG）、依存语法（DG）和范畴语法（CG），提供了一种数学推导方法，展示出如何用统一系统分析不连续表达以及连续结构。

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

TL;DR: 提出一个三步推理框架来提高大模型在幻觉检测任务上的表现，实验证明该方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于蕴涵分类是复杂的推理任务，因此大模型需要通过生成显式推理过程来提高理解和检测幻觉的能力。

Method: 提出一个三步推理过程：声明分解、子声明归因与蕴涵分类、以及聚合分类，并引入一套分析方案来度量中间推理步骤的质量。

Result: 引导推理方案确实提高了幻觉检测的质量，并提供了一套度量中间推理步骤质量的指标作为实证证据。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种引导大语言模型进行系统和全面推理的方案，该方案通过分解文本为较小的事实并寻找每个事实的证据，从而提高幻觉检测的性能。

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

TL;DR: Micro-Act框架通过分层行动空间解决RAG系统的知识冲突问题，在QA任务中显著提升性能，并在多种冲突和非冲突情况下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决RAG系统中知识冲突的问题，提出一种新方法，以避免直接比较两个知识源导致的内容过多和复杂的问题。

Method: 提出了Micro-Act框架，该框架具有分层行动空间，能够自动感知上下文复杂性，并自适应地将每个知识源分解为一系列细粒度比较。这些比较被表示为可操作步骤，支持超越表面上下文的推理。

Result: Micro-Act在5个基准数据集上超越其他方法，在特别是所有基线均失败的时间与语义冲突类型上表现良好。

Conclusion: Micro-Act在所有5个数据集和3种冲突类型上的QA准确性都显著优于最先进的基线，特别是在时间和语义类型上表现突出。此外，它在非冲突问题上也表现出色，突显其在实际RAG应用中的实用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

TL;DR: ProRefine通过提示优化，大大提高了多步骤推理任务的准确性，使得小模型可以匹敌大模型，促进了高效和可扩展的AI应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协同工作流在推理或规划等复杂任务中常出现错误传播和性能不足，主要由于设计不佳的提示无法有效引导个体智能体，限制了这些系统的可靠性和可扩展性。

Method: 引入ProRefine，通过在推理时利用大型语言模型的文本反馈来动态优化多步骤推理任务的提示，而无需额外训练或真实标签。

Result: 在五个基准数学推理数据集上评估，ProRefine较无训练链式思维基线提高了3到37个百分点。

Conclusion: ProRefine通过优化提示，显著提高了多步骤推理任务的准确性，使得较小模型能够达到与较大模型相近的性能，从而促进了高效、可扩展的AI部署，并使高性能AI的使用更加普及。

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Motivation: 当前方法在遗忘与保留信息之间的权衡中常出现优化不稳定和保留数据的性能下降，尤其是在需要大规模遗忘时。本研究旨在解决这些问题，提升遗忘的有效性和保留性能。

Method: 使用约束优化问题来处理遗忘，通过logit-margin扁平化损失来驱动输出分布的统一，并通过可扩展的原始-对偶算法解决问题。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，本方法在多种语言模型架构下均表现出与或超过现有最先进基线的效果，成功地删除目标信息并保留下游效用。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的大语言模型的遗忘机制，通过将遗忘问题形式化为一个约束优化问题，并使用新的logit-margin扁平化损失来驱动输出分布归一化，从而有效地删除目标信息，同时保留下游实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

Motivation: 现有数据集规模有限且范围狭窄，无法有效分析搜索增强型语言模型。

Method: 搜索增强型语言模型结合了网络搜索与大型语言模型。

Result: 用户偏好受到引用次数影响，即使引用内容未直接支持声明。

Conclusion: 搜索增强型语言模型能够提升响应的准确性和信息的新鲜度。

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现语言模型在对齐和评估中优先选择表面模式而非实质质量，由此导致偏差问题，需要系统地研究训练数据偏差与模型失准之间的关系并提出解决方案。

Method: 使用合成对比实例进行对比数据增强(CDA)的后续训练方法来微调模型，以降低偏差和失衡。

Result: 经过微调，偏差从39.4%降至32.5%，偏差差异从20.5%降至10.0%，同时保持了整体的RewardBench性能。

Conclusion: 通过使用合成的对比实例，将模型与对比数据增强进行微调，可以有效降低偏差，并在不影响整体性能的情况下，提高模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

Motivation: 解决传统方法在转换基模型时需要重新训练，且由于数据限制可能造成挑战的问题。

Method: 通过将源调整投射到目标模型的权重空间，利用子空间和零空间相似性，并有选择地定位对齐层实现数据迁移。

Result: 在已有的文本到图像模型上的评估显示：无需重训练即可成功进行知识迁移，并且性能可与重训练的方法相媲美。

Conclusion: ProLoRA成功实现了无需重训练的数据迁移，并在文本到图像模型中表现良好。

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

Result: 该方法明显减少了不当信息披露，同时在多个模型尺寸和家族中保持任务性能。改善不仅限于合成数据集，还转移到具有人工注释的已有CI基准上，如PrivacyLens。

Conclusion: 使用强化学习框架显著减少不当信息披露，并保持任务性能，同时改进从合成数据集到现有CI基准的转移能力。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI
collaboration.

Motivation: To address the hallucination issue of industrial codes and emissions in LLMs, which affects regulatory and investment decisions in sustainable manufacturing.

Method: The authors introduced CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework, which incorporates a domain-specific knowledge graph and utilizes SPARQL for converting natural language queries to verified subgraphs.

Result: CircuGraphRAG demonstrated superior performance in question answering tasks, achieving ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, halved response time, and reduced token usage by 16% compared to Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG.

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG significantly enhances the performance and efficiency of LLMs in addressing circular economy queries with fact-checked and regulatory-ready information.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific

translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%

Conclusion: HADA架构能够在不依赖特定框架或协议的情况下，优化多代理系统中的人机对齐，提升实际决策流程中的准确性、透明度和伦理合规性。

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate

TL;DR: EXIF框架可以自动发现和扩展LLM代理的技能，通过闭环数据生成过程提高训练的有效性并显著提升性能，无需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在环境中进行训练以获取所需技能并执行多样化任务的LLM代理受到了越来越多的关注，以实现无限可能性。然而，为他们的技能获取创建训练数据集面临多个挑战。人工收集轨迹需要大量人力；LLM直接提出学习任务的方法通常是无效的，因为LLM缺乏对哪些任务实际可行的知识。此外，所生成的数据可能无法提供有意义的学习信号，因为代理在提出的任务上表现通常已经很好。

Method: 我们提出了一种新颖的自动技能发现框架EXIF，设计用于提高生成目标行为的可行性，同时考虑代理的能力。我们的方法采用探索优先策略，通过使用探索代理Alice来训练目标代理Bob，以在环境中学习基本技能。具体来说，Alice首先与环境交互，以追溯地生成一个可行的、以环境为基础的技能数据集，然后用于训练Bob。我们采用迭代反馈循环，其中Alice评估Bob的性能以识别需要改进的地方。此反馈然后指导Alice进行下一轮探索，形成闭环数据生成过程。

Result: 实验在Webshop和Crafter上展示了EXIF有效发现有意义技能的能力，并在无人工干预的情况下迭代扩展训练代理的能力，取得了显著的性能提升。我们观察到，将Alice设置为与Bob相同的模型也显著提升了性能，展示了EXIF构建自我进化系统的潜力。

Conclusion: EXIF框架能够有效发现和扩展LLM代理的技能，提供了一个闭环的自动数据生成过程，消除了对人工干预的需求，并显著提高了性能，展示了其成为自我进化系统的潜力。

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

*Jack David Carson,Amir Reisizadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种统计物理学框架来模拟Transformer语言模型的推理动态，以理解潜在推理阶段和失效状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer语言模型表现出难以通过机械方式理解的推理能力。为了更好地理解此类语言模型的推理动态，提出了一种新的统计物理学框架。

Method: 采用将句子级别的隐藏状态轨迹建模为低维流形上的随机动态系统。此系统使用潜在的状态切换来捕捉多种推理阶段，包括对齐失效状态和错误。通过经验轨迹分析，使用秩为40的投影解释了约50%的方差。

Result: 发现了四种潜在的推理机制，并通过SLDS模型对这些机制进行了验证和建模。该框架不仅能进行低成本的推理模拟，也提供了研究和预测关键转变（如状态失效或其他模型失效）的工具。

Conclusion: 开发了一种基于统计物理学的框架，能够模拟和理解Transformer语言模型中的连续时间链式推理动态。

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望通过提高假设筛选的准确性来降低实验成本，并提高发现重要结果的概率，使发现系统能够大规模运行。

Method: 通过引入Matter-of-Fact挑战数据集，评估现有强基线模型在假设可行性判断上的表现。

Result: 当前使用科学文献检索增强生成和代码生成的强基线模型在该任务上表现不超过72%，而领域专家确认显示几乎所有的任务都是可解决的。

Conclusion: 引入的Matter-of-Fact数据集展示了当前模型在判断假设可行性方面的局限，同时也展现了将此领域推进以加速科学发现的潜力。

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

TL;DR: 大语言模型在表格问答中表现良好，但在处理多表问答时仍面临困难。本文提出利用人类整理的关系知识的图形框架，构建可解释的推理链，以提高效率和一致性。实验表明该方法在复杂工业数据中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现在的大语言模型在多表格问答方面表现不佳，主要是因为它们难以处理复杂表格中的模式链接问题。现有基于语义相似度的方法只在简化的人工数据集上有效，无法应对多样且复杂的真实世界场景。因此，有必要探索更有效的方法来处理多表格问答。

Method: 提出了一种基于图的框架，该框架利用人类整理的关系知识显式编码模式链接和连接路径。通过在给定自然语言查询时构建可解释的推理链，并辅以修剪和子路径合并策略来提高效率和一致性。

Result: 在标准基准和一个现实的大规模数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多表格问答中表现出色，尤其是在复杂的工业数据中应用时。这是首个在真正复杂的工业表格数据上应用的多表格问答系统。

Conclusion: 通过利用关系知识和图结构，可以有效地解决多表问答中的模式链接问题，并且在复杂工业数据中能够实现有效的推理。这为多表格问答提供了一种可扩展和解释性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用AI异常检测的排名监控系统，大幅提升公共卫生数据监控效率，审查效率提高54倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的警报式监控系统在处理现代公共卫生数据监控时面临诸多挑战，尤其是警报阈值的不断重设和数据量大导致的应用滞后。因此需要一种可扩展的方法来监控大规模健康数据。

Method: 提出一种基于排名的监控范式，利用新的AI异常检测方法。在全国组织中部署监测多达5,000,000个数据点。

Result: 经过三个月的长期部署评估，与传统方法相比，监控目标显著提高，审查速度效率提高54倍。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了人本中心的AI在公共卫生决策中显著提高监控效率的潜力。

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential
of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明，当前最先进的大语言模型在处理大型匹配市场时，存在明显的推理能力不足，尤其是在解决不稳定性方面。LoRA微调在小规模市场中有效，但在大规模情境中效果有限，需更复杂的改进策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理任务中取得显著进展，但在处理组合域中排序偏好和结构算法方面的能力仍需探索。匹配市场是资源分配和共享出行等应用的核心框架，需要调和个人的排序偏好以确保稳定的结果。

Method: 评估多种最先进模型在一系列基于偏好推理任务上的表现，涵盖稳定匹配生成、不稳定检测、不稳定解决及细粒度偏好查询等任务，从而系统地揭示这些模型在处理排序输入时的逻辑和算法局限性。

Result: LoRA微调在小型市场中显著提高表现，然而在处理大型市场实例中无显著改善。

Conclusion: 当前的最先进模型在处理大型市场中不稳定问题时存在显著的不足，尤其是在识别阻塞对和迭代执行算法方面。尽管LoRA微调可在小型市场中改善性能，但在大型实例上效果有限，需要更复杂的策略来提高对大规模上下文输入的推理能力。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

TL;DR: 提出CogMath以更精细地从人类认知角度评估大型语言模型的数学能力，发现现有模型的能力被高估，并揭示了其优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评价方法仅依赖于对总体回答准确性的粗略衡量，这对于评估大型语言模型的真实能力是不足的。因此，提出了CogMath从人类认知的视角来全面评估数学能力。

Method: CogMath将人类的推理过程形式化为三个阶段，并在每个阶段设计了9个精细评估维度。利用多代理系统生成查询以评估大型语言模型在各个维度的掌握情况。

Result: 通过在三个基准上应用CogMath，该方法揭示了主流大型语言模型的真实数学能力，并找到了它们在具体阶段和维度上的长处与短板，为进一步提升推理能力提供了深入的见解。

Conclusion: 通过CogMath的评估，揭示出7种主流大型语言模型的数学能力被高估了30%-40%。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

Motivation: 在机器人导航中，如何将复杂的空间、数学和条件约束从自然语言转化为规划问题中的形式描述是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了一种名为STPR的约束生成框架，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）将约束转化为可执行的Python函数。

Result: 通过在模拟Gazebo环境下的实验，证明了STPR能够在多种约束和场景下确保完全合规，并且运行时间较短。同时，验证了STPR可与更小的代码特定LLMs结合使用。

Conclusion: STPR有效地融合了LLM的编码能力，将语言问题描述转化为结构化代码，实现复杂约束的准确表达，并在点云表示和传统搜索算法中应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

Result: 实验结果展示了LLM在生成高质量 ShEx schemas 方面的潜力，为大规模自动化生成开辟了可能性。

Conclusion: 实验表明，LLM在生成高质量 ShEx schema 方面具有强大潜力，为大规模知识图谱的自动化 schema 生成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured
generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

TL;DR: DeePoly effectively combines DNNs and polynomial methods to solve PDEs with high accuracy and efficiency, addressing the limitations of traditional DNN approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DNN methods for solving PDEs lack convergence guarantees and computational efficiency, which DeePoly aims to improve by combining deep learning and polynomial methods.

Method: DeePoly uses a two-stage approach: first, a DNN is used to capture complex global features, followed by linear space optimization combining DNN-extracted features and polynomial basis functions.

Result: The approach achieves enhanced high-order accuracy and efficiency across various problems, supported by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.

Conclusion: DeePoly, by integrating DNNs with polynomial optimization, provides both high accuracy and computational efficiency while maintaining flexibility in problem application.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

Conclusion: GUI-Critic-R1显著提高了多模态大型语言模型在动态评估和静态实验中的批评准确性和操作成功率。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前法律领域的自然语言处理应用虽然多样，但在推理任务上存在不足。本研究旨在通过创建一个专注于法律推理任务的基准，检验模型在实际公司治理法律中推理能力。

Method: 提出了一个企业治理推理基准（CHANCERY），要求模型判断行动是否符合企业治理章程中的规则，这是一个二元分类任务。基准数据来自24个公司治理原则和79个真实企业治理章程，并对现有的先进推理模型进行评估。

Result: 经过对当前最先进的推理模型的评估，发现不同框架（如ReAct和CodeAct）的推理代理表现优于其他模型，表现分数分别为76.1%和78.1%，这表明需要高级法律推理能力才能在该基准上获得较高分数。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了目前的推理模型在法律推理任务上的性能差异，并表明CHANCERY基准可以作为评估和改进语言模型法律推理能力的有效工具。

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

TL;DR: 研究表明，LLM代理在战略规划能力上具有自我改进的潜力，通过自我进化表现优于静态基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现在的LLM作为自主代理在许多任务中表现优秀，但在长期策略制定和坚持上仍存在困难。研究其是否能在挑战战略规划能力的环境中自我改进。

Method: 以开源Catanatron框架的棋盘游戏《卡坦岛移民》中使用LLM代理进行实验，发展出从简单的游戏代理到能够自主重写自己的提示和玩家代理代码的系统，并引入包含不同角色（分析者、研究员、编码员、玩家）的多代理架构，通过协作分析游戏、研究新策略及修改代理逻辑或提示。

Result: 自我进化的代理特别是由像Claude 3.7和GPT-4o这样的模型驱动时能够超越静态基准，能够自主采用策略，向游戏代理传递示例行为，并在多次迭代中展示出适应性推理能力。

Conclusion: 自我进化的LLM代理在战略能力的自我改进方面有显著的潜力。与经过人工设计的代理相比，其自我演化表现更优秀。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用LLM的框架，用于从非结构化事故报告中提取电动自行车事故数据，发现设备问题更常见，但人为问题更致命，分类准确性F1达到0.87。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于电动自行车事故报告中存在非结构化的叙述格式，阻碍了定量的安全性分析，因此本研究旨在通过LLM代理转录事故报告信息，提高电动自行车的安全性分析。

Method: 该研究应用了四个LLM代理，分别处理数据分类、信息提取、伤害原因确定和部件关联，从非结构化事故报告中提取关键因素。此外，还使用有序logit模型来研究事故严重程度与所提取因素之间的关系。

Result: 研究表明，设备问题比人为问题略为常见，但人为相关事故更常导致致命事件。模型在分类准确性方面获得了0.87的高加权F1分数。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一个使用大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的框架来分类和提取电动自行车事故报告中的安全变量。结果表明，人为相关事故更容易致命，并且此框架在分类准确性方面取得了高加权F1分数。

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to
accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in
classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract
unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a
scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable
information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

TL;DR: 该研究引入了一种基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的新方法改进MMO经济模拟，证明这种方法有效解决了现有方法在模拟中遇到的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的使用基于代理模型（ABM）的MMO经济研究面临着模拟人类经济活动的困难，尤其是代理的可靠性、社交性和可解释性方面的挑战。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的角色扮演能力、生成能力和推理能力，设计了具有人类决策和适应性的LLM驱动代理。

Conclusion: 该研究引入了使用大型语言模型（LLMs）来改进MMO经济模拟中决策代理的设计，证明了LLM驱动的代理具有人类决策的类似性和适应性。

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research,
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game
economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced
by reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, existing works encounter significant
challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among
agents, particularly regarding agent reliability, sociability, and
interpretability. In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a
novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation.
Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning
aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and
adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing,
perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges
effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities
demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role
specialization and price fluctuations in line with market rules.

TL;DR: 研究采用分析框架揭示RL对推理的影响，加强模型内部策略的形成和执行，对难题的训练提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL训练方法显示出显著的经验收益，但对其优势的细粒度理解仍然不足。

Method: 引入一种细粒度分析框架，调查RL对推理的影响。

Result: RL可以增强模型将所提供知识整合到其推理过程中的能力，从而在不同任务上提高性能。

Conclusion: 我们的研究为更系统的推理模型训练和评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

Motivation: 发现在不同评估条件下，推理模型的表现波动显著，难以可靠复现声称的性能提升。

Method: 通过实证评估Deepseek-R1-Distill系列模型，分析其在不同条件下评估结果的波动。

Result: 在对Deepseek-R1-Distill系列模型的实证评估中，发现其性能受评估条件变化的影响很大。

Conclusion: 现有的推理模型在性能评估中存在显著波动，需要更加严格的评估标准。

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于本体的骨病诊断框架，尽管理论基础已建立，但由于当前数据集和计算资源的限制，实验验证尚未完成。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的模型驱动的强化学习框架，通过动态切换机制和动态安全阈值，实现了任务性能和安全性的同步优化，优于现有非自适应方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实世界场景中应用强化学习时需要优先考虑安全性和可靠性，但模型驱动的强化学习固有的模型不准确性可能导致安全关键环境中的灾难性失败。因此，需要一种既能优化任务性能又能确保安全性的模型驱动方法。

Method: 结合了一种自适应机制，在模型驱动的规划和直接策略执行之间动态切换，使用隐式的世界模型解决传统模型驱动方法的目标不匹配问题。此外，采用动态安全阈值，根据代理的能力变化调整，选择超过安全策略建议的行为。

Result: 实验表明，与非自适应方法相比，该方法在性能和安全性方面同时优化，而不仅仅是满足最低安全要求。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的模型驱动的强化学习框架，能够同时优化任务性能和安全性，并在多种安全关键的连续控制任务上实现了稳健性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

TL;DR: A method for LLMs to control embodied agents by mapping observations to actions, refined through feedback and validated on control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLMs to directly control embodied agents by mapping observation vectors to action vectors and improving control strategies iteratively.

Method: The method involves LLMs initially generating a control strategy based on a textual description, which is then iteratively refined using performance feedback and sensory-motor data.

Result: The method is validated on classic control tasks and the inverted pendulum task, demonstrating successful identification of optimal solutions.

Conclusion: The method successfully identifies optimal or high-performing control strategies by integrating symbolic reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor data.

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

Motivation: 随着具有链式思维推理能力的先进系统可能会战略性地误导人类，研究大语言模型的诚信问题成为一个关键的对齐挑战。

Method: 使用线性人工断层扫描（LAT）技术提取“欺骗向量”，并通过激活操控实现了在没有明确提示的情况下成功诱导符合上下文的欺骗。

Result: 通过研究，研究人员能够以89%的检测准确率识别战略欺骗，并通过激活操控获得了40%的成功率来诱导适当的欺骗行为。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过使用表示工程，我们可以系统性地引导、检测和控制大语言模型中的战略欺骗行为。这为开发可靠的AI对齐工具提供了可能。

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Motivation: 通过学习局部更新规则来保持元胞自动机的离散特性，同时利用神经网络的适应性进行可编程运算，推动编程材料和稳健计算系统的发展。

Method: 该模型的基本计算单元是可微分逻辑门，组合成电路。在训练期间，模型可进行端到端的梯度训练，而在推理时，它在完全离散的状态空间中运行。

Result: 该方法通过几个关键例子展示了其多样性：（1）完全学习康威的生命游戏规则，（2）生成对噪声和损坏具有抗扰性的棋盘图案，（3）生成蜥蜴形状，（4）多色图案生成。

Conclusion: 此研究首次成功地将可微分逻辑门网络应用于循环架构中，表明这种DLGNs与NCA的结合在可编程材料和稳健的计算系统中迈出了一步，融合了二进制逻辑、神经网络适应性和本地化处理能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的自主系统架构，为在资源波动环境中部署自主代理提供理论和架构基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

Motivation: 当前LLMs在选择和应用正确数学公式及执行精确的多步算术上存在问题。

Method: 我们提出了RAG-UAV这一检索增强生成框架，通过提供相关领域文献，改进了LLMs在UAV特定背景下的数学推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，使用RAG框架显著提高了精确答案的准确性，减少了错误公式选择的实例，并显著降低了MSE。

Conclusion: RAG显著提高了LLMs在UAV任务中的数学推理能力，虽然对于直接实时飞行控制仍需大规模验证。

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

TL;DR: 引入一个内在元认知学习框架以改善自我改进代理的能力，使其能够更有效地进行自我评估、计划与反思。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自我改进代理面临的两大局限性：其自我改进过程常常刻板，难以跨任务领域泛化，且随着代理能力的提高难以扩展。

Method: 提出一个包含三个组件的正式框架：元认知知识（对能力、任务和学习策略的自我评估）、元认知计划（决定学习的内容和方式）以及元认知评估（反思学习经验以改善未来学习）。

Result: 分析现有自我改进代理后发现，内在元认知的许多要素已经存在。

Conclusion: 有效的自我改进需要内在的元认知学习，探索如何在人与代理之间理想地分配元认知责任。同时，通过分析现有自我改进代理，发现它们主要依赖于外部元认知机制，这些机制是固定和人类设计的循环，限制了可扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

TL;DR: 提出LLM-First Search方法，通过LLM自主引导搜索，提升灵活性与上下文敏感性，在两种游戏中表现出色而且更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的搜索方法如MCTS由于其固定的探索超参数限制了其在难度不同的任务中的适应性，因此需要一种更灵活且无需人工调整的搜索策略。

Method: 提出了一种新的名为LLM-First Search (LFS)的LLM自引导搜索方法，该方法依赖于大型语言模型自身的评分机制来决定是否继续当前的搜索路径或探索其他分支。

Result: 在Countdown和Sudoku上的评估结果表明，LFS在无需额外调整的情况下，在更具挑战性的任务上表现更好，并且在计算效率上优于其他方法，尤其是在使用更强模型时。

Conclusion: LLM-First Search (LFS)方法通过消除预定义搜索策略的需求，使得大型语言模型能够自主控制搜索过程，实现了灵活性和上下文敏感性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other

*Violet Xiang,Chase Blagden,Rafael Rafailov,Nathan Lile,Sang Truong,Chelsea Finn,Nick Haber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 引入ALP以优化推理模型的token使用量，显著减少计算浪费并提高困难问题的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过生成更少的token来减少计算浪费，特别是在简单问题上，并在困难问题上提高性能。

Method: 文中采用了一种名为自适应长度惩罚（ALP）的强化学习目标，通过对每个提示的在线解决率进行监测，并加入与该解决率成反比的可微分惩罚，以调整生成长度。

Result: 使用ALP训练的DeepScaleR-1.5B模型在平均token使用量减少50\%的情况下，不显著降低性能，并在最困难的问题上取得更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 文中提出的自适应长度惩罚（ALP）方法有效降低了推理模型的平均token使用量，并在不显著降低性能的情况下提高了在困难问题上的准确性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

Conclusion: HASHIRU框架为多智能体系统提供了一种灵活、高效和适应性强的新方法。

Abstract: Rapid Large Language Model (LLM) advancements are fueling autonomous
Multi-Agent System (MAS) development. However, current frameworks often lack
flexibility, resource awareness, model diversity, and autonomous tool creation.
This paper introduces HASHIRU (Hierarchical Agent System for Hybrid Intelligent
Resource Utilization), a novel MAS framework enhancing flexibility, resource
efficiency, and adaptability. HASHIRU features a "CEO" agent dynamically
managing specialized "employee" agents, instantiated based on task needs and
resource constraints (cost, memory). Its hybrid intelligence prioritizes
smaller, local LLMs (via Ollama) while flexibly using external APIs and larger
models when necessary. An economic model with hiring/firing costs promotes team
stability and efficient resource allocation. The system also includes
autonomous API tool creation and a memory function. Evaluations on tasks like
academic paper review (58% success), safety assessments (100% on a
JailbreakBench subset), and complex reasoning (outperforming Gemini 2.0 Flash
on GSM8K: 96% vs. 61%; JEEBench: 80% vs. 68.3%; SVAMP: 92% vs. 84%) demonstrate
HASHIRU's capabilities. Case studies illustrate its self-improvement via
autonomous cost model generation, tool integration, and budget management.
HASHIRU offers a promising approach for more robust, efficient, and adaptable
MAS through dynamic hierarchical control, resource-aware hybrid intelligence,
and autonomous functional extension. Source code and benchmarks are available

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

Conclusion: HoAs-PALN算法在动态灾后环境中表现出有效性，能够提升任务完成率并在较短时间内做出调度决策。

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

Result: 本文提出了用于分析CAIS的多维分类法，分析了四种基础范式，并识别了包括可扩展性、互操作性、基准测试和协调等关键挑战，同时提出了未来研究的方向。

Conclusion: 本文调查了组合人工智能系统（CAIS）的现状，提出了多维分类法，并分析了四种基础范式：检索增强生成（RAG）、大型语言模型代理、多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）和以协调为中心的架构。本文综述了代表性系统，比较设计权衡，并总结了这些范式中的评估方法。

Abstract: Compound Al Systems (CAIS) is an emerging paradigm that integrates large
language models (LLMs) with external components, such as retrievers, agents,
tools, and orchestrators, to overcome the limitations of standalone models in
tasks requiring memory, reasoning, real-time grounding, and multimodal
understanding. These systems enable more capable and context-aware behaviors by
composing multiple specialized modules into cohesive workflows. Despite growing
adoption in both academia and industry, the CAIS landscape remains fragmented,
lacking a unified framework for analysis, taxonomy, and evaluation. In this
survey, we define the concept of CAIS, propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy
based on component roles and orchestration strategies, and analyze four
foundational paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM Agents,
Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), and orchestration-centric architectures. We review
representative systems, compare design trade-offs, and summarize evaluation
methodologies across these paradigms. Finally, we identify key
challenges-including scalability, interoperability, benchmarking, and
coordination-and outline promising directions for future research. This survey
aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive foundation
for understanding, developing, and advancing the next generation of
system-level artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Communication is a fundamental aspect of coordinated behavior in multi-agent
reinforcement learning. Yet, most prior works in this field have focused on
emergent communication protocols developed from scratch, often resulting in
inefficient or non-interpretable systems. Inspired by the role of language in
natural intelligence, we investigate how grounding agents in a human-defined
language can improve learning and coordination of multiple embodied agents. We
propose a framework in which agents are trained not only to act but also to
produce and interpret natural language descriptions of their observations. This
language-augmented learning serves a dual role: enabling explicit communication
between agents and guiding representation learning. We demonstrate that agents
trained with our method outperform traditional emergent communication baselines
across various tasks. Our analysis reveals that language grounding leads to
more informative internal representations, better generalization to new
partners, and improved capability for human-agent interaction. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating structured language into
multi-agent learning and open avenues for more interpretable and capable
multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 在许多真实世界的异步场景中，如群聊、团队会议或社交游戏中，发言时机是参与者决策的重要部分，现有的LLM主要集中在同步通信中，因此需要开发能够处理异步通信的LLM代理。

Method: 开发了一种异步LLM代理并收集在线Mafia游戏的数据，通过该数据来评估代理的表现，重点关注代理在何时发言的能力。

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

Conclusion: 该论文研究了生成扩散模型与连续态联想记忆模型之间的联系，强调了Morse-Smale动力系统作为梯度型联想记忆模型和扩散模型的白噪声扰动系统的通用逼近性。

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

Conclusion: 该论文提供了关于概念驱动模型的风险和局限性的全面调查，专注于汇集常见的挑战以及减轻这些挑战的架构选择。

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

Conclusion: 通过使用马尔科夫逻辑网络（MLNs）增强现有的OOD检测器，可以显著提高其性能，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 本研究证明了将transformer架构应用于材料科学问题的可行性，展示了数据驱动的方法在改变结构行为预测和工程设计实践中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

Result: 实验展示了该方法在各种LLMs、数据集和风险类别中的有效性，能够提供精确控制，防止过度拒绝，并指导模型生成安全且具有主题相关的内容。

Conclusion: 简单和有效的方法，如SafeSteer，能够在不需要复杂技术的情况下增强语言模型的安全性调整。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while
maintaining topic relevance.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

Conclusion: MUC-G4提供了一种有效的方法来确保压缩神经网络在实际应用中的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

Motivation: 理解变压器如何在不同的学习机制下执行关系推理任务，并探索其如何推广上下文关系推理能力。

Method: 研究比较了两种不同的学习机制：权重内学习（IWL）和上下文内学习（ICL）。使用心理学中的经典关系推理任务——易推理判断来调查变压器模型的推理能力。

Conclusion: 训练具有结构的任务可以促进表示的开发，从而支持上下文关系推理。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

Conclusion: LDPTRLQ算法在保持队列稳定性的同时，通过有效结合Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty算法与强化学习，优于基线方法，验证了理论推导的正确性，同时在兼容性和稳定性方面表现优于其他基准。

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of
interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use
in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel
framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models
with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously
generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information
without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively
optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs
on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks
within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new
paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial
prediction.

Abstract: Ensuring grid stability in the transition to renewable energy sources
requires accurate power demand forecasting. This study addresses the need for
precise forecasting by differentiating among industrial, commercial, and
residential consumers through customer clusterisation, tailoring the
forecasting models to capture the unique consumption patterns of each group. A
feature selection process is done for each consumer type including temporal,
socio-economic, and weather-related data obtained from the Copernicus Earth

Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) and Very Short-Term Load Forecasting (VSTLF)
are explored and compared, determining the most effective approaches. With all
that, the main contribution of this work are the new forecasting approaches
proposed, which have demonstrated superior performance compared to simpler
models, both for STLF and VSTLF, highlighting the importance of customized
forecasting strategies for different consumer groups and demonstrating the
impact of incorporating detailed weather data on forecasting accuracy. These
advancements contribute to more reliable power demand predictions, thereby
supporting grid stability.

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to
Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency
metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management
under dynamically uncertain conditions.

considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

Method: 对不同代理设计和测试时缩放策略进行全面的系统级分析，量化其资源使用、延迟行为、能耗以及数据中心范围内的功耗需求。

Result: AI代理的计算需求揭示了即将面临的可持续性危机，呼吁在实际约束条件下设计一种新的计算高效的推理方法，以达到性能和可部署性之间的平衡。

Conclusion: AI代理在提高计算能力的同时，面临迅速递减的收益、日益增大的延迟变化以及无法持续的基础设施成本。

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

Conclusion: RedRFT作为一个简化和标准化RFT-based红队测试的轻量级基准工具，其设计结合了CleanRL和Tianshou的优点，并通过实施关键组件的广泛消融研究来促进对RFT性能影响因素的理解。

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features
for RFT-based red teaming. Code for the benchmark can be accessed at
https://github.com/x-zheng16/RedRFT.git.

TL;DR: YOTO方法可以通过单次训练优化损失超参数，超过了网格搜索方法在计算机视觉任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统网格搜索方法需要多次训练的问题，旨在通过一次训练优化损失选择和配置。

Method: 通过将损失权重超参数视为网络的常规参数，并利用标准的梯度优化算法进行自动优化。

Result: 在计算机视觉领域的3D估计和语义分割任务中，YOTO方法在未见测试数据上表现优于网格搜索方法。

Conclusion: YOTO方法在单次训练中优化损失超参数和常规模型参数，并在计算机视觉领域的多个任务中超过了网格搜索方法。

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度网络中，隐藏层通常需要大量参数，如何减少参数数量同时保持性能是一个重要问题。

Method: 提出了一种“半”隐藏单元层：组合固定随机权重和可训练权重，两种阶段处理输入。

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上进行实验，实现了较高准确率且参数数量减少。

Conclusion: 使用随机连接的半隐藏层能够在减少参数的同时取得合理的准确性。

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

Method: 提出了一种新的复合奖励函数，该函数由年化收益、下行风险、差异收益和Treynor比率四个可微分的项组成，并通过权重进行参数化，以反映不同的投资者偏好。通过网格搜索调整这些权重，以目标特定的风险收益率。

Result: 该框架提供了一般性的蓝图用于在复杂的交易环境中构建稳健的多目标奖励函数，并且可以通过添加额外的风险措施或自适应加权进行扩展。

Conclusion: 这种方法较单一指标的方法在理论性质上更具优越性，例如单调性、有界性和模块化。

Abstract: We propose a novel composite reward function for reinforcement learning in
financial trading that balances return and risk using four differentiable
terms: annualized return downside risk differential return and the Treynor
ratio
  Unlike single metric objectives for example the Sharpe ratio our formulation
is modular and parameterized by weights w1 w2 w3 and w4 enabling practitioners
to encode diverse investor preferences
  We tune these weights via grid search to target specific risk return profiles
  We derive closed form gradients for each term to facilitate gradient based
training and analyze key theoretical properties including monotonicity
boundedness and modularity
  This framework offers a general blueprint for building robust multi objective
reward functions in complex trading environments and can be extended with
additional risk measures or adaptive weighting

Conclusion: 通过在Beltrami-Klein模型中重新表达hyperDT算法，改进了灵活性、速度和准确性。同时简化了代码库的可维护性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

Motivation: 为了解决持续学习中的遗忘问题，通过对样本重播的理论分析来深入理解和改善其效果。

Method: 本文提供了样本重播在过参数化的持续线性回归设置中的理论分析，通过实验和理论揭示重播样本的作用以及任务子空间之间的关系。

Result: 发现即便在无噪声设定中，重播样本的数量与遗忘不是单调关系，在某些任务下重播可能有害。此外，在与线性模型和神经网络中都观察到相似的行为。

Conclusion: 样本重播的方法在某些情况下可能加剧遗忘，尤其是与任务子空间关系密切相关。在看似无噪声的设定中，遗忘可能不会随重播样本数量的增加而单调减小。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

Motivation: 去掉目标网络可以释放内存用于扩展在线网络容量，但会导致不稳定性和性能下降。本研究旨在解决这一问题，并利用迭代Q学习的概念，缩小无目标和目标方法之间的表现差距。

Method: 提出了一种名为iS-QL的新方法，使用在线网络最后一层的线性层副本作为目标网络，并与最新的在线网络共享其余参数，实现目标网络和无目标网络方法之间的平衡。

Result: 研究结果表明，iS-QL方法提高了无目标方法的样本效率，并且在多种环境下表现出色。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的iS-QL方法在减少内存占用的同时，与经典目标网络方法相比，其训练时间相当，表明其在扩展强化学习研究方面具有潜力。

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

Method: UMCNP结合参数化策略梯度（PPG）和任务推断的方法，在元训练中重用通过PPG收集的样本，以离线方式学习任务推断。在元测试中，利用条件神经过程（CNPs）提高效率，减少在线交互次数。在单个测试任务的rollout中推断动态模型的潜在表示。

Result: UMCNP在2D-Point Agent和连续控制元强化学习基准（如cartpole和walker agent）上，用更少的样本适应了看不见的测试任务。

Conclusion: UMCNP在无奖励信号的元测试中表现出色，能够以更少的样本高效适应未见过的测试任务，相较于基线方法，表现更优。

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

Result: 验证了CL和NSCL损失之间的差距以O(1/类数)速率衰减。新提出的小样本误差界紧密估计探测性能。

Conclusion: 标准对比学习目标实际上接近于一种名为仅负样本监督对比损失（NSCL）的监督变体。

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

TL;DR: The paper introduces zero-order optimization methods for efficient fine-tuning of large language models, offering algorithms that reduce memory usage without sacrificing performance, and establishes convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models for downstream tasks requires optimization methods that can efficiently adapt these models while minimizing memory and computational costs.

Method: The paper explores zero-order optimization methods as a cost-effective alternative to traditional first-order optimizers like SGD and Adam, particularly focusing on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA. Two novel algorithms, JAGUAR SignSGD and JAGUAR Muon, are proposed.

Result: The proposed zero-order algorithms demonstrate convergence quality equal to or better than standard first-order methods while significantly reducing memory usage, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Zero-order optimization methods are shown to be a practical and theoretically grounded solution for efficiently fine-tuning large language models under resource-constrained conditions, with the potential for broader application.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统的二阶优化方法需要昂贵的二阶梯度计算，而这种计算在神经网络训练中可能效率低下。作者希望通过一种方法来有效进行优化而不需要依赖于复杂的二阶梯度。

Method: 使用基于扩展式 Kalman 优化算法来模型结构化梯度的不确定性，通过递归更新紧凑梯度协方差积来直接估计参数协方差矩阵。

Result: 在包括图像分类和语言建模的不同任务中，KOALA++的精度与最先进的一阶和二阶优化器相当或更好，而保持了一阶方法的效率。

Conclusion: KOALA++能够在保持一阶优化效率的同时，达到与全新二阶优化方法相当或更高的准确度，展现出其在实际应用中的优势。

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

Motivation: 研究神经网络中的反“掌握”现象，尤其是在深度学习训练过程后期出现的测试准确度骤降问题。

Method: 使用三层感知器在MNIST数据集上进行训练，同时通过开源工具WeightWatcher进行重尾自正则化分析。

Result: 发现一种新的第三阶段——反“掌握”现象，在训练后期测试准确度下降，而训练准确度保持完美。

Conclusion: 反“掌握”现象可以通过HTSR的层质量指标α和相关陷阱来揭示，并且这一发现提供了一种无需测试数据就能衡量过拟合和泛化崩溃的方法。

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

*Gil I. Shamir,Manfred K. Warmuth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种选择性匹配损失函数，以提高某些重要区域的预测准确性，与传统损失相比表现出显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在某些领域的某些区域，产生准确的预测至关重要，而在其他区域则不那么重要。因此，需要一种能够在重要区域提高预测准确性的学习系统。

Method: 通过构建选择性匹配损失函数来解决该问题。这些损失函数通过设计递增的链接函数在评分域上进行。链接函数决定了损失对于评分的敏感性，强调高斜率的高敏感区域，而忽略平坦区域。

Result: 选择性损失在具有重要评分区域的应用中比传统损失具有显著优势，例如驻留时间预测、检索、排序等。

Conclusion: 通过调整模型的损失敏感性，使得它在重要区域中能够进行更好的预测，从而解决模型在这些区域的预测不确定性。

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

TL;DR: ODXU框架通过神经符号AI方法和迁移学习策略，成功提高了网络入侵检测的性能和数据使用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络威胁越来越复杂，现有的网络入侵检测系统需要提高其鲁棒性、可解释性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用NSAI框架进行网络入侵检测，结合深度嵌入式聚类进行特征提取，使用XGBoost符号推理，并进行不确定性量化。

Result: 在CIC-IDS-2017数据集上的实验表明，ODXU在分类准确性和错误排除率等六个评估指标上表现优于传统神经模型；在ACI-IoT-2023数据集的迁移学习中表现出色。

Conclusion: ODXU框架在网络入侵检测中的性能优于传统神经网络模型，并成功应用于迁移学习以提高数据使用效率。

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

Result: 强调了行为系统性和表征系统性之间的区别，并探讨如何更好地评估和实现ML模型中的表征系统性。

Conclusion: 现有的基准和模型主要关注行为的系统性，而不是表征的系统性。

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Result: 神经网络模型使用所有20个特征时达到了最高准确率94.1%，其次是梯度提升(93.2%)和随机森林(93.0%)。特征排名揭示了治疗服务计数等特征在区分提供者类型中的重要性，而人口统计变量的影响较小。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过特征选择可以显著提高模型的效率和准确性，有助于优化牙科服务提供者的分类，从而实现资源的精准分配。

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service

categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and

followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine

significantly enhance dental workforce classification. Their integration into
healthcare analytics can improve provider identification and resource

Motivation: 在资源受限的情况下，选择模型和适应策略是具有挑战性的，通常需要大量的实验。论文探讨是否可以无需昂贵的试验准确预测性能和成本。

Method: COSMOS 通过一对强大的预测器实例化了该框架，包括嵌入增强的轻量级代理模型用于预测微调性能，以及用于预测检索增强的上下文学习的低样本缩放定律。

Result: 在八个具有代表性的基准测试中，COSMOS 在减轻计算成本的同时实现了高预测准确性，平均减少 92.72%，在资源密集型场景下最多可减少 98.71%。

Conclusion: 高效预测适应性结果不仅是可行的，而且可以在保持性能标准的同时显著减少LLM部署的计算开销。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型在训练过程中虽然确保较高准确性，但在校准能力方面不足的问题。

Method: 在训练过程中进行梯度正交化的处理，并在实验中比较正交梯度（$\perp$Grad）与SGD优化方法。另从理论上验证了一种简化的正交梯度方法的收敛性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，使用10%标记数据进行测试，正交梯度方法在准确性上与SGD相当，但校准指标有明显提升。这些优势在输入扰动情况下和扩展训练时仍然存在，且正交梯度方法比SGD模型在退化时更为平稳。

Conclusion: 梯度正交化在训练过程中能够提高模型的校准能力，而不影响准确性。

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

Motivation: 目前的蛋白质结构预测模型能够从序列生成准确的三维结构假设，但常常无法捕捉动态生物分子复合物的构象多样性。冷冻电镜作为成像近原生结构异质性的有力工具面临从原始实验数据到原子模型的繁琐流程问题。

Method: 提出了一种新方法CryoBoltz，它结合了冷冻电镜密度图和蛋白质结构预测模型学习到的丰富序列及生物物理先验信息，以密度图衍生的全局和局部结构约束引导预训练的蛋白质结构预测模型的采样轨迹。

Result: 该方法允许在各种动态生物分子系统的异质冷冻电镜图中构建原子模型，包括运输蛋白和抗体。

Conclusion: CryoBoltz方法通过结合冷冻电镜密度图和蛋白质结构预测模型，成功在动态生物分子系统中实现了符合实验数据的构象状态预测。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

Conclusion: PGT能够在无法或不可能进行反向传播的情况下实现与标准方法相当的性能，是将物理储层与更深层次神经网络架构整合的潜力方向，并在AI训练中实现显著的能量效率提升。

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense
network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental
hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers offer a powerful tool for modeling complex dynamical
systems, but often struggle with error accumulation over long time horizons and
maintaining stability and physical consistency. We introduce a multiscale
implicit neural emulator that enhances long-term prediction accuracy by
conditioning on a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations.
Drawing inspiration from the stability properties of numerical implicit
time-stepping methods, our approach leverages predictions several steps ahead
in time at increasing compression rates for next-timestep refinements. By
actively adjusting the temporal downsampling ratios, our design enables the
model to capture dynamics across multiple granularities and enforce long-range
temporal coherence. Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics show that our
method achieves high short-term accuracy and produces long-term stable
forecasts, significantly outperforming autoregressive baselines while adding
minimal computational overhead.

Motivation: 当前大规模语言模型训练面临着跨区域通信成本过高及异构硬件利用不均的问题。

Method: 提出一种分层异步优化框架HALoS，通过在每个区域内引入局部参数服务器（LPS）和全局参数服务器（GPS）以合并跨区域更新。

Result: HALoS在地理分布的LLM训练中比同步基准快7.5倍的收敛速度，并比现有异步方法提高最高2.1倍，同时还能保持或超过完全同步SGD的模型准确性。

Conclusion: 证明了分层服务器端更新累积和全球模型合并是新一代LLM在异构地理分布环境中进行高效可扩展训练的有力工具。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed
environments.

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to improve time series prediction by addressing the limitations of deep learning methods, particularly their inability to model non-stationary data and abrupt changes effectively.

Method: The paper introduces Neural MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion model. This model formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential equation simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous Itô diffusion and a time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process. A likelihood truncation mechanism and an Euler-Maruyama with restart solver are used to improve learning and estimation accuracy.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the Neural MJD model over existing deep learning and statistical learning methods.

Conclusion: Neural MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical learning methods in time series prediction, particularly in non-stationary environments with abrupt changes.

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled
datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate
science, biomedicine, astronomy, chemistry, and more. However, despite its
widespread utilization, there is a lack of standardization in unsupervised
learning workflows for making reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries.
In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning
techniques in science. We highlight and discuss best practices starting with
formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data
preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing
rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

Motivation: 针对以往的均匀采样方法在产生异构主题的敏感输入时导致生成文本质量下降的问题，提出聚类方法以提高文本生成质量。

Method: 引入一种新算法，该算法通过聚类输入数据选择推理批次，并采用私有的中位数统计方法替代均值来聚合下一个token的统计数据。

Result: 新方法在表现力指标和下游任务性能方面有改进，且在隐私成本方面优于此前的先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过将输入数据进行聚类并利用中位数统计估算方法，系统可以生成高质量的合成数据且达到更低的隐私成本。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for

Conclusion: 保留方向语义能够显著提高解释质量，为人类决策者提供更忠实的见解。研究强调在安全关键性应用中需要具备方向感知的GNN可解释性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical domains, where
reliable explanations are vital for supporting human decision-making. However,
the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information,
leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our
analysis demonstrates how this practice compromises explanation fidelity.
Through theoretical and empirical studies, we show that preserving directional
semantics significantly improves explanation quality, ensuring more faithful
insights for human decision-makers. These findings highlight the need for
direction-aware GNN explainability in security-critical applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了通过使用双向界限稳定EBM训练的方法，以避免传统下界最小化导致的不稳定性，取得了更好的密度估计和样本生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于能量的模型（EBMs）虽然在估计未归一化的密度上表现优异，但通常难以训练。为了避免最小化下界导致的不稳定性问题，提出使用双向界限的方法来最大化下界并最小化上界。

Method: 研究四种从不同视角出发的对数似然的界限，并提供了评估这些界限的算法。分别基于生成器雅可比行列式的奇异值和互信息推导出下界。为了对负对数似然进行上界，我们考虑类似梯度惩罚的界限和基于扩散过程的界限进行处理。

Result: 通过实验比较了不同界限的方法的利弊，证明了双向界限方法在稳定性和高质量生成方面的优势。

Conclusion: 使用双向界限方法可以稳定训练EBM，并产生高质量的密度估计和样本生成。

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Conclusion: 通过遍历代理图并近似风险值，提出的算法能够有效找到近乎最优的代理组合，适用于宽泛的实际损失函数。

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical model that addresses the economic trade-off between

inference at scale. Our model takes into account arithmetic, memory bandwidth,
network bandwidth and latency constraints; and optimizes over different
parallelism setups and batch sizes to find the ones that optimize serial
inference speed at a given cost per token. We use the model to compute Pareto
frontiers of serial speed versus cost per token for popular language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型预训练基础模型规模和能力的不断扩展，如何高效地将它们适应到特定的下游任务中变得越来越关键。尽管在这一领域已经取得了实质性的进展，但现有的适应方法大多处于孤立发展的状态，缺乏对其相互关系的清晰理解。

Result: 该框架能够稳定地应用于各类数据模态，与特定模型架构无关。通过这种视角可以揭示既有技术理论上的联系以及实践上的区别。同时，分析了剩余的技术挑战和伦理考虑，并将神经网络可重编程性定位为高效模型适应的基础范式。最后，识别出了从这一整合观点中出现的有前景的研究方向。

Conclusion: 论文提出了利用神经网络界面的敏感性来进行信息操控的方法，从而实现模型行为的重定向。引入了一种分类学，可以按照操控格式、位置、操作符和输出对齐要求来复杂化此类适应方法。

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

Motivation: 研究者们普遍认为过度平滑限制了深度图神经网络（GNNs）的性能。本文的动机是挑战这种观点，认为过度平滑的影响被过分强调，并提倡进一步探索深度GNN架构。

Method: 该研究通过仔细分析GNNs的三大核心操作：聚合、线性变换和非线性激活，发现之前的研究将过度平滑与梯度消失问题相混淆，梯度消失是由变换和激活引起的，而非聚合。

Result: 研究结果表明，通过使用经典方法（如跳跃连接和归一化处理），可以成功堆叠深层GNN层而不出现性能下降。

Conclusion: 本文澄清了对过度平滑的误解，并展示了深度GNN的潜力，挑战了过度平滑是GNNs特有问题的观念。

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习中，由于用户差异和多种数据模态的存在，不同设备的数据集通常不是独立同分布的，而使用单一模型变得不切实际。部分模型个性化虽然能缓解这些问题，但可能加剧客户端漂移问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于乘数交替方向法的联邦学习框架FedAPM，通过在目标函数中引入一阶和二阶逼近项来构建增强的拉格朗日函数，以减轻客户端漂移问题。

Result: FedAPM在四个异构多模态数据集上进行了实验验证，其收敛速度更快且更准确，平均测试精度提高12.3%，F1分数提高16.4%，AUC提高18.0%，所需通信轮次更少。

Conclusion: FedAPM通过使用拉格朗日乘数的显式估计，相比其他联邦学习框架在收敛上更稳定、更高效，并在各种数据集中验证了其优越的性能。

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

Motivation: 随着数据集规模的不断扩大和预测模型的复杂性增加，在预测准确性与计算成本之间的权衡越来越重要，特别是在时间序列预测的集成学习背景下。

Method: 评估了十种基础模型和八种集成配置，并使用了两个大型零售数据集，考虑了不同再训练频率下的点和概率精度。

Result: 集成方法能够显著提高预测性能，特别是在概率设置中。尽管如此，这些提升是在较高的计算成本下实现的，尤其是针对较大的、以准确性为导向的集成。减少再训练频率显著降低了成本，对准确性影响不大。此外，以效率导向的集成提供了良好的平衡，以相对较低的成本实现了有竞争力的准确性。小型的二至三模型集成通常足以达到接近最佳的结果。

Conclusion: 精心设计的集成方法和再训练策略可以产生准确、稳健且具有成本效益的预测，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

TL;DR: DIPNet通过输入的分布式表示，提高网络的平滑性和泛化能力，适用于多种模型和任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过参数化模型中，训练损失难以有效解释泛化性能，需要寻找新的方法来增强网络的平滑性以促进泛化。

Method: 引入Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet)，在每一层将输入投射到可学习的分布中，从而实现损失景观的平滑性。

Result: DIPNet在各种架构和任务中验证有效性，增强了测试性能，并能应对标准设置、对抗攻击和分布外输入。

Conclusion: DIPNet通过将输入投射到可学习的分布中，提高了神经网络的损失平滑性和泛化性能。

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

Method: 提出了一种专门为图神经网络设计的近端Bregman响应函数。这个方法放宽了凸性要求，使标准神经网络架构能够进行准确的影响预测，并将影响预测扩展到边的删除和插入。

Conclusion: 我们的研究提供了一种更灵活和准确的方法来预测图神经网络中边的影响，并展示了该方法在图重构和对抗性攻击等应用中的实用性。

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 当前虽然增强强化学习在提升模型能力方面取得了显著成功，但其改善推理能力的机制仍然理解不足，因此本文系统研究RLVR以揭示其实际益处。

Method: 本文通过简化的问题-推理-答案模型进行了理论分析，研究了RLVR的收敛和训练动态。同时进行广泛实验以验证理论发现。

Result: 实验表明RLVR训练的模型偏好采用高成功率的推理模式，并提出两种关于RLVR训练收敛的不同模式。对弱推理能力模型的优化可以通过在RLVR之前应用监督微调来改善。

Conclusion: RLVR可以有效优化现有推理模式的选择，使模型倾向于采用高成功率的推理模式，同时在单个模式上保持稳定表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 研究提出了使用卫星数据和机器学习模型的新方法，成功分类孟加拉国干旱严重程度，但显示出地区间的显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的干旱指数如SPI和PDSI忽视了土壤湿度和温度等关键因素，且现有的机器学习模型在孟加拉国的应用研究不足，缺乏对多个地区卫星数据的全面整合。

Method: 提出了一种卫星数据驱动的机器学习框架，使用无监督算法（如K均值和贝叶斯高斯混合）进行聚类，然后使用分类模型（如KNN、随机森林、决策树和朴素贝叶斯）进行分类。该框架整合了气象数据，包括湿度、土壤湿度和温度。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一个卫星数据驱动的机器学习框架，可有效分类孟加拉国不同地区的干旱严重程度，展示了模型识别和预测干旱条件的能力。

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服传统分歧如 KL 或 Wasserstein 距离中不具备的某些性质，如凸性及一致性，从而更好地训练生成模型。

Method: 本文介绍 dual-ISL，这是一种新颖的无似然目标，交替 ISL 框架中的目标与模型分布，导致模型密度空间上的凸优化。

Result: 理论上证明 rank-based 差异 $d_K$ 的连续性和凸性，实验证明 dual-ISL 在多个基准测试中训练更迅速、平稳，且有效防止模式崩溃。

Conclusion: 引入的 dual-ISL 方法较传统的 ISL 及其他生成模型更快速收敛，训练更平稳，有效防止模式崩溃，同时提供显式的密度近似。

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

Motivation: 随着生成模型的广泛应用和隐私、法律合规要求的增加，如何快速删除特定数据的影响变得尤为迫切。

Method: 提出基于损失梯度正交化的快速非遗算法，在不涉及繁琐重新训练的情况下，从生成模型中去除特定数据的影响。

Result: 在MNIST和CelebA数据集上，算法实现了比先前方法（如梯度手术）快数个数量级的非遗时间。

Conclusion: 提出的快速非遗算法能够有效地遗忘指定数据，同时保持生成模型的原始准确性，并显著加快非遗速度。

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

*Fei Ding,Baiqiao Wang,Zijian Zeng,Youwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGRPO introduces a two-layer self-correction mechanism to improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs, outperforming standard GRPO in math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for proposing MGRPO is to address the inefficiencies of GRPO caused by the lack of intermediate supervision, which can lead to unstable training due to abrupt reward vanishing caused by errors in reasoning chains.

Method: MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer generates an initial response using standard GRPO, and the second layer identifies and corrects errors in the initial response, thus creating a self-correction loop without requiring explicit dense reward models.

Result: Experimental results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO achieves superior performance compared to standard GRPO.

Conclusion: MGRPO significantly outperforms standard GRPO in mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving both reasoning and self-correction abilities.

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

Motivation: 注意力机制是Transformer中一个重要的基础，用于准确和可扩展的序列建模。然而，其二次计算和线性内存复杂性成为显著瓶颈。

Method: 本文提出了对数线性注意力机制，取代固定大小的隐藏状态为对数增长的隐藏状态集合我们展示了一种特定增长函数，使对数线性注意力可以使用和线性注意力类似的并行形式，其计算成本在序列长度上是对数线性的。

Result: 我们通过将对数线性注意力应用于现有的线性注意力变体，具体实例分析了Mamba-2和Gated DeltaNet的对数线性变体，发现其表现优于线性时间变体。

Conclusion: 对数线性注意力机制在保持线性注意力效率的同时提高了softmax注意力的表现力，并且可以作为一个通用框架应用于现有的线性注意力变体之上。

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at

Motivation: 研究具有重尾奖励的随机线性Bandit问题，以提高minimax遗憾的上界和下界。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于消除的算法，引导通过实验设计，并导出了与多臂Bandit问题相关的改进上界和下界。

Result: 算法实现了改进的后悔率，并对有限动作集进行了类似的改进，还提供了一些特别几何中的动作集依赖遗憾上界。

Conclusion: 研究展示了在重尾线性Bandit问题中对遗憾率的优化，特别是在某些几何中的处理和无限维度设置中的遗憾度量。

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了$k$-medoids和KDE通过Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) 之间的结构关系，并提供了对QUBO权重参数几何解释的新见解。

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study identifies that Adam's preconditioners themselves can trigger loss spikes during training due to instability caused by mismatched gradient and moment estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the root causes of loss spikes during training with the Adam optimizer, beyond the previously thought sharper characteristic of the loss landscape as the cause.

Method: The mechanism was investigated through theoretical analysis and verified via extensive experiments across different neural network architectures including fully connected networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

Result: Identified that Adam's preconditioners can lead to instability when the squared gradients are significantly smaller than second-order moment estimates, pushing the maximum eigenvalue of the preconditioned Hessian beyond stable thresholds and causing loss spikes.

Conclusion: Adam optimizer's adaptive preconditioners can cause loss spikes by creating conditions where the gradient-directional curvature exceeds stability thresholds, leading to instability and resulting in a spike in loss.

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

Motivation: 标准微调流程可能会灌输狭窄的、特定领域的启发式方法，而不是培养通用思维策略。

Method: 使用一种“玩中学”框架，通过强化学习对大语言模型进行微调，训练模型解决一套由七个定制逻辑谜题构成的问题。此方法使用具有可验证奖励的强化学习设置，模型根据谜题的正确性接收二进制反馈，鼓励迭代、假设驱动的问题解决。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑谜题的强化学习训练可以重新塑造LLMs的内部推理能力，使其能够在不依赖任务特定的符号工具的情况下实现更强和更具组合性的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稀疏自编码器和变分自编码器虽然广泛应用，但其基础结构多年来几乎没有改变，存在潜在的弱点，这促使了对新的、改进模型的研究。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的混合自编码器模型，不仅能够解决原有稀疏自编码器和变分自编码器的弱点，还能在不影响重构误差的情况下生成更稀疏的潜在表示。

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了对比损失在多模态表示学习中的局限性，提出了改进方法以增强表示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比损失未能有效学习对齐的表示空间，因而需要改进损失函数以去除模态特定信息。

Method: 通过信息瓶颈原理描述问题，并提出基于变分近似的正则化项以改进损失函数。

Result: 引入正则化项后，在控制实验和实际应用中展示了表示对齐的优势。

Conclusion: 对比损失用于多模态表示学习时，并不能有效学习到对齐的表示空间。通过理论和实验分析，找出了问题的根源并提出了正则化方法以提高对齐。

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

### [216] [There Was Never a Bottleneck in Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04877)
*Antonio Almudévar,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MCBMs, improving interpretability over CBMs by ensuring each component retains only concept-relevant information using an Information Bottleneck objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance interpretability and address CBMs' shortcomings where a component predicting a concept does not ensure encoding only information about that concept.

Method: The paper introduces Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs) incorporating an Information Bottleneck (IB) objective through a variational regularization term added to the training loss.

Result: MCBMs provide theoretical guarantees for concept-level interventions, align with Bayesian principles, and offer flexibility in design.

Conclusion: MCBMs address CBMs' interpretability limitations by constraining representation components to retain only concept-relevant information, supporting concept-level interventions with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

TL;DR: 通过结合高斯过程与微分同胚法，GPDSSM模型提高了髋关节发育不良分类的准确性，并简化了临床流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期诊断髋关节发育不良以降低髋关节骨关节炎风险，为此开发了一种新的CT扫描分类体系。

Method: 结合高斯过程潜变量模型框架与微分同胚法建立统计形状模型（GPDSSM），采用192个CT扫描用于训练和测试。

Result: GPDSSM不仅提高了分类准确率，也节省了临床医生手动测量角度和解读2D扫描的时间。

Conclusion: GPDSSM方法有效地区分发育不良样本与正常样本，并提高分类准确性，相较角度法提升AUC评分至96.2%。

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管通过强化学习训练长上下文推理模型取得了进展，但仍然存在一些开放性问题和反直觉行为。本研究旨在系统分析这些问题，以提高模型的泛化能力和数据效率。

Method: 系统分析正负样本在强化学习中的作用，探索数据利用率低的问题，并讨论不稳定表现的原因和解决方案。

Result: 正样本主要帮助数据拟合，而负样本显著增强泛化和鲁棒性；识别到群体相对策略优化中的数据低效问题，并通过相对长度奖励和离线样本注入来提升数据利用效率和推理能力；提出多次评估运行可以缓解模型在稳定性上的问题。

Conclusion: 负样本在提升通用性和鲁棒性方面具有重要作用，特别是在仅基于负样本训练时，性能与标准强化学习训练相当。提高数据利用效率和解决性能不稳定性是增强推理模型能力的关键。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Motivation: 早期识别高风险ICU患者对于分配有限的医疗资源至关重要。

Method: ALFIA是一种模块化的注意力架构，通过联合训练LoRA适配器和自适应层加权机制，融合来自BERT骨干网的多层语义特征。采用ALFIA的融合模块生成的嵌入，可以与GBDTs（CatBoost/LightGBM）和深度神经网络无缝结合，形成ALFIA-boost和ALFIA-nn，获得额外的性能提升。

Conclusion: ALFIA在早期预警性能上表现出色，为临床医生提供了便利且强大的风险分层和及时干预工具。

Abstract: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is crucial for directing
limited medical resources. We introduce ALFIA (Adaptive Layer Fusion with
Intelligent Attention), a modular, attention-based architecture that jointly
trains LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting
mechanism to fuse multi-layer semantic features from a BERT backbone. Trained
on our rigorous cw-24 (CriticalWindow-24) benchmark, ALFIA surpasses
state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC while preserving a balanced
precision-recall profile. The embeddings produced by ALFIA's fusion module,
capturing both fine-grained clinical cues and high-level concepts, enable
seamless pairing with GBDTs (CatBoost/LightGBM) as ALFIA-boost, and deep neuro
networks as ALFIA-nn, yielding additional performance gains. Our experiments
confirm ALFIA's superior early-warning performance, by operating directly on
routine clinical text, it furnishes clinicians with a convenient yet robust
tool for risk stratification and timely intervention in critical-care settings.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了在预测性维护场景中，意图分解、代理协调以及自主决策的可行性，证实了这种方法在降低技术壁垒和实现可扩展、意图驱动自动化方面的潜力。

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large
language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities,
enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction
(HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable,
and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,
the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous
decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the
potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable,
intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

TL;DR: FPTQuant介绍了四种轻量且功能保持的变换，以优化大型语言模型的量化过程，提高效率并在精度与速度之间取得优良的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在不显著降低性能的情况下实现高效量化，本研究旨在解决大规模语言模型在推理时由于大幅度异常值导致性能显著下降的问题。

Method: 为了保持模型功能的同时使中间激活分布更适合量化，设计了四种新颖、轻量且具表现力的函数保持变换（FPTs），这些变换不依赖于自定义内核且在推理时几乎没有额外开销。

Result: FPTQuant实现了静态INT4量化，最高速度提升达3.9倍，较其他方法具有优越的准确性-速度权衡特性，并且仅比比对方法准确性稍低。

Conclusion: FPTQuant可以实现静态INT4量化，并且在准确性与计算速度之间具有优秀的平衡。在不显著降低精度的情况下，提高了计算速度，达到最新技术水平速度的3.9倍。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

TL;DR: 引入"Cautious Optimism"框架，通过调整FTRL以加速广义博弈中的无悔学习，获得了优越的后悔值表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用于在广义博弈中加速无悔学习的"Cautious Optimism"框架的提出是为了证明通过适应性地控制学习步调来加速无悔学习并非偶然现象。

Method: 论文引入了一种名为"Cautious Optimism"的框架，该框架对任何指定的FTRL实例进行调整，通过适应性地控制学习者的步调，从而输出一种加速的无悔学习算法，并保持最小的计算开销。

Result: 该方法在不同的自对抗场景中实现了接近最优的$O_T(\log T)$后悔值，同时在对抗情形下保持了最优的$O(\sqrt{T})$后悔值。

Conclusion: 本文提出的"Cautious Optimism"框架能够实现在广义博弈中的加速无悔学习，与既有方法相比无需依赖单调步长，展现了一种实现快速学习的新方法。

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

Motivation: 提出一种新的概念瓶颈模型，以提高模型推理的透明性和任务性能。

Method: 引入概念推理模型CREAM，该模型使用架构嵌入和侧通道正则化技术来处理概念间以及概念与任务间的关系。

Result: CREAM依赖概念进行任务预测，其性能与黑箱模型相当。此外，通过${\texttt{C-C}}$和${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$关系嵌入，减轻了概念泄露。

Conclusion: 概念推理模型CREAM能够在保持概念重要性的同时实现竞争性任务性能，并简化模型干预过程。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

Result: MPP编码具有形状中心性和连续性的特性，能够基于几何特征区分空间对象，并以高精度捕获成对的空间关系。

Conclusion: MPP编码方法优于基于栅格化的替代方法，在编码地理空间对象和捕获空间关系上表现更好。

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

Motivation: 目前的研究主要集中于通过训练卷积神经网络逐步优化和恢复真实标签，缺乏对提供可转移表示的基础模型的研究。因此，本文着眼于通过全面评估基础模型在部分标签学习中的表现，探讨其可能的优势和局限性。

Method: 提供了对11个基础模型在8个基准数据集上的13种PLL方法的评估，并提出了PartialCLIP，一种适用于基础模型的高效微调框架。在实验中，使用零样本CLIP的文本嵌入分类器初始化和候选标签过滤。

Result: 实验结果表明，基础模型的使用显著提高了PLL方法的性能，同时各PLL方法在不同模糊度水平下的表现保持稳定。然而，这些方法对基础模型的选择和适应策略非常敏感。文本嵌入分类器初始化和候选标签过滤方法有效。

Conclusion: 当前的部分标签学习（PLL）方法在使用基础模型时，可以显著提高性能，但不同的方法性能非常相似并且在不同模糊度水平下保持稳定。同时，这些方法很容易受到基础模型选择和适应策略的影响。提出的PartialCLIP框架有效提高了基础模型在PLL中的表现。

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is
available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/Cross-Class-Features-AT.

Motivation: Existing XAI methods for time series fail to capture the directional impact of points, leading to suboptimal identification of significant points, and current evaluation metrics do not effectively assess the capability of capturing both positive and negative impacts.

Method: The paper introduces new evaluation metrics - Cumulative Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP) - and proposes TIMING, which incorporates temporal awareness into the Integrated Gradients method for better performance in time series analysis.

Result: The proposed TIMING method, evaluated with novel metrics CPD and CPP, outperforms conventional Integrated Gradients and recent XAI baselines for time series data in experiments.

Conclusion: TIMING enhances the Integrated Gradients method by incorporating temporal awareness, demonstrating superior performance over existing time series XAI baselines.

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

### [228] [iN2V: Bringing Transductive Node Embeddings to Inductive Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05039)
*Nicolas Lell,Ansgar Scherp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: iN2V改进了node2vec，使其适用于未见节点的归纳学习设置，实验显示其大幅提升了节点分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的嵌入方法如node2vec（N2V）在处理新节点时受到限制，因为它们只能在训练期间访问整个图，包括测试节点，这使得它们仅限于传递性设置。

Method: 提出了一种称为iN2V的改进方法，通过结合后期集成的方法计算训练中未见节点的嵌入，并对原始N2V训练程序进行修改来准备这种后期集成。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，iN2V是一种有效的方法，可以将传递性嵌入带入归纳设置。使用iN2V嵌入，节点分类平均提高1个点，最高可提高6个点，具体取决于数据集和未见节点的数量。

Conclusion: iN2V是一种插件方法，可以生成新的嵌入或丰富现有嵌入。它还可以与其他嵌入方法结合使用，是一种灵活的归纳节点表示学习方法。

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without
features or to supplement existing features with structure-based information.
Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which
restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to
reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/Foisunt/iN2V .

TL;DR: 提出了D3M算法以监控模型性能退化，并验证了其在高风险环境中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于数据分布随时间变化，需要对动态环境中的模型进行重训练。由于某些变化会导致模型性能下降，（且）没有标签情况下很难确定何时重训练。

Method: 提出了一种基于预测模型分歧的监控算法D3M，通过低假阳性率监测非退化转变，并在退化转变中提供高真阳性率的样本复杂度界限。

Result: 在标准基准和一个真实世界的大规模内科数据集上进行的实验证明了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: D3M是一种有效的监控算法，可以用于检测模型性能的退化，并能在高风险机器学习管道中作为警报机制。

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

TL;DR: NIMO 结合了线性模型的可解释性和神经网络的表现力，通过非线性修正和优化算法提高了预测准确性，同时维持线性解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性模型具有易于解释的优势，但不够表达力，而神经网络（NNs）虽然表现卓越却难以解释。研究的动机是希望结合两者的优点：保留线性模型解释性的同时提升表达能力。

Method: 提出了NIMO（非线性可解释模型），设计了神经网络来学习对线性模型预测的非线性修正。同时，利用基于参数概貌似然的优化算法使得在优化神经网络参数的同时仍能解析地更新线性系数。此外，利用自适应岭回归也加入了稀疏化约束。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在明显提高预测准确性的同时，可以恢复潜在的线性系数。相比其他混合可解释方法，该模型是唯一能够维持线性模型线性系数解释性的模型。此外，在各种回归和分类情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: NIMO 模型成功地结合了线性模型的解释性和神经网络的高表达力，提高了预测准确性，同时维持了解释性。

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

Motivation: 解决HiPPO假设数据无噪声的问题，并在实践中提高状态空间模型处理噪声数据的能力。

Method: 将HiPPO理论扩展为包含测量噪声，通过将HiPPO理论解释为线性随机控制问题，将数据视为噪声控制信号，重新构造问题，使数据成为潜在系统的噪声输出，并推出一个推断潜在系统后验的新初始化方法。

Result: 改进的初始化方法能够在不增加运行时间的情况下，从数据中推断潜在系统的后验。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，新的初始化方法提高了状态空间模型在训练和推断过程中的抗噪能力。

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

Motivation: 现有的半隐式变分推断方法在高维条件下训练仍然较为昂贵。

Method: 提出了一种核化的KL散度估计器，通过非参数平滑来稳定训练，并引入重要性采样校正来进一步减少偏差。

Result: 理论上证明了提出的方法与Stein变分梯度下降的摊销版本之间的联系，且实际结果表明新方法在性能和训练效率上优于或匹配现有最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 新方法实现了较低的梯度方差及较稳定和高效的优化过程。新的半隐式方法在功能空间的偏差是良性的。

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

Motivation: 探讨合成数据在隐私放大方面的潜力，尤其是在生成模型隐藏时可能带来的隐私放大效果。

Method: 使用线性回归框架，分别探究在不同情况下合成数据的隐私泄露和隐私放大的现象。

Result: 发现如果攻击者控制生成模型的种子，单个合成数据点可能泄露与模型本身相同的信息；相反地，当合成数据从随机输入生成时，限制释放的合成数据点数量可以增强隐私保护。

Conclusion: 在合成数据生成过程中，通过适当的方法可以实现隐私放大，线性回归的研究可进一步推广到更一般的界限推导。

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

Motivation: 现有方法的一个关键限制是定义在完整轨迹层面的奖励，无法为优化推理过程的中间步骤提供足够的指导。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的方法\name，通过树采样估计各种推理步骤的奖励的数学期望。与依赖单独步骤奖励模型的先前方法不同，\name直接通过采样过程估计这些奖励。\name基于GRPO的组相对奖励训练机制，创新性地计算基于树采样过程中生成的步骤级组的奖励。

Conclusion: 这种方法提供了比以往方法更细粒度和密集的奖励信号，从而显著增强了LLMs的学习过程和整体性能。实验结果表明，\name算法显著提高了Qwen-2.5-Math在测试基准上的平均Pass@1准确率，从19.0\%提高到35.5\%。此外，\name在性能上显著超越了GRPO，提升了2.9\%，同时将平均响应长度减少了18.1\%，展现了其有效性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness
and efficiency. Our code will be available at

TL;DR: 研究提出了LPMT框架，通过整合扩散过程和热力学马尔可夫过渡实现更准确的流形距离测量，从而提高实例检索的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的重排序方法在通过相似性传播来建模数据流形方面相当有效。然而，正向信号往往在距源头数步之后减弱，从而降低了局部区域之外的辨别能力。为了解决这个问题，本文引入了一种新的LPMT框架来提高流形距离测量的准确性。

Method: 本文介绍了一种名为局部保持马尔可夫过渡（LPMT）的框架。首先通过双向协作扩散（BCD）在不同图表中整合扩散过程，以建立强大的相似关系。之后，局部状态嵌入（LSE）将每个实例编码为一个分布，以增强局部一致性。这些分布通过热力学马尔可夫过渡（TMT）过程相互连接，实现了高效的全局检索，同时保持了局部有效性。

Result: 该方法通过实验验证，在各种任务中的实例检索方面表现有效。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，LPMT在各种任务中的实例检索方面表现有效。

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

Motivation: 现有文献中大多将transformers看作算法逼近器，而本工作希望用通用函数逼近理论来提供一种新的视角，帮助理解transformers的上下文学习能力。

Method: 构建一个不需要进一步权重更新的transformer，通过几个上下文例子就能实现可靠的预测，采用的是基于通用函数逼近的方法。

Result: 所提出的方法在不受限于被逼近的优化算法有效性的情况下提供了逼近保证，从而扩展到远超出凸问题和线性函数类的范围。

Conclusion: 提出了以通用函数逼近理论为基础的方法来解释transformers在上下文学习中表现的能力。

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

TL;DR: SHARP通过HAR对比损失缓解GNN中的节点度偏差问题，实验表明其在多数据集上表现优于基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）在节点分类任务中常常受到节点度偏差的影响，即预测性能在具有不同度数的节点之间存在差异。尽管一些方法采用了图对比学习（GCL）来缓解这种偏差，但其有限的正样本对数量和所有正负样本的等权重仍导致低度节点获得的信息不足且噪声较大。

Method: 提出了一个名为HAR的对比损失，通过利用节点标签增加正样本对，同时基于学习难度自适应地加权正负样本对。此外，还开发了一个名为SHARP的实验框架，将HAR扩展到更广泛的场景中。

Result: 四个数据集的实验结果表明，SHARP在全局和度数水平上都比基准方法表现更好。

Conclusion: SHARP可以有效缓解图神经网络中的节点度偏差问题，在节点分类任务中取得了更好的性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

Conclusion: 提出的去中心化鲁棒核学习算法为鲁棒回归提供了统一的去中心化学习框架，与现有的分布式鲁棒核学习方案显著不同。该算法实现了在RKHS中鲁棒回归的有效逼近和学习收敛。

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

Motivation: 计算Shapley值计算复杂度高，现有方法缺乏理论保证，尤其是KernelSHAP方法。

Method: 提出广泛的统一框架，采用有放回和无放回抽样策略，并通过理论证明提供非渐近的保证。进行了全面的基准测试和特定实现改进。

Result: 实验结果表明，在小型和中型维度数据集上，与确切的Shapley值相比，低均方误差一致性地实现，且在高维数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文通过提出一个统一框架来计算Shapley值，首次为KernelSHAP提供了理论保证，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

TL;DR: Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency in Recurrent Memory Transformers, offering significant speedups by enabling parallelism in memory updates, without needing retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the performance bottleneck in RMTs caused by their sequential execution in updating memory, thereby improving inference speed and efficiency.

Method: A scheduling scheme called Diagonal Batching is used to unlock parallelism in Recurrent Memory Transformers (RMTs) across input segments.

Result: Diagonal Batching achieves a 3.3x speedup over standard full-attention implementation and a 1.8x speedup over sequential RMT implementation for large-token sequences.

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching significantly enhances RMT model performance, yielding faster inference by enabling parallel computation across segments without retraining.

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

Motivation: 现有神经采样器在效率上不及当前最强的MCMC方法（并行退火）。PT在需要重新采样时计算成本较高。因此，需要一种能够高效生成样本的方法。

Method: 提出了渐进退火采样器（PTSD），它通过在不同温度下顺序训练扩散模型，将高温扩散模型的输出进行组合以生成低温样本，最后经过MCMC进行修正。

Result: 方法能够高效重用样本信息，生成去相关的样本，并显著提高目标评估效率，超越现有的基于扩散的神经采样器技术。

Conclusion: PTSD方法成功结合了MCMC和扩散模型的优势，能够高效生成去相关的样本，同时提高目标评估效率，超过基于扩散的神经采样器。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

Method: 研究采用数值稳定的、支持chunk并行化的新型Mesa层，结合一种快速共轭梯度求解器，在语言建模任务中进行测试。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过在神经网络中解决序列优化问题来增加测试时的计算，可以获得更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

Method: 使用展开匹配追踪（unrolling Matching Pursuit）的方法，提出了多迭代稀疏自编码器（MP-SAE），用于在手写数字生成等多层次设置中提取相关特征。

Result: 多迭代SAE在提取MNIST数据集的相关特征和保证更多原子选择时的重构单调改进方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 本文提出的多迭代稀疏自编码器（MP-SAE）能够有效克服传统SAE的局限性，通过匹配追踪算法实现了阶层中相关特征的提取，验证其在MNIST数据集上的效果。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

Conclusion: 单层Transformer可以在适当的初始化下，通过梯度下降实现线性收敛率，而残差连接对于改善不良条件及增强优化稳定性至关重要。

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SSMs需要符合物理原则的专用学习算法及高效技术来模拟及设计系统，我们提出了一种算法来解决这一需求。

Method: 提出一种称为RHEL的算法，该算法通过有限差分计算非耗散Hamiltonian系统的物理轨迹的损失梯度。并将其离散化以适用于Hamiltonian Recurrent Units。

Result: RHEL在从中程到长程的时间序列分类和回归任务中应用，展示了其与BPTT算法一致的性能，证明了其可扩展性和能效。

Conclusion: RHEL算法能够在不显式计算雅可比矩阵的情况下，通过三次前向传递计算损失梯度，并且在各种测序任务中，其性能与BPTT一致。

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

Result: 找到了使每种方法达到最佳可能收敛速率的Lyapunov函数，并进行了严格的对比分析，提供了明确的性能保证。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了对EF和EF^{21}进行分析的严密方法，确保了这两种方法的最佳收敛速率，并进行了对比分析。

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

Conclusion: CocktailEdit框架通过结合信心加权锚点控制和基于分类器的控制机制，成功实现了多样约束下的时间序列精确编辑。

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

Motivation: 解决基于Shapley值的计算复杂度问题，尤其是不需要对每个测试样本重新训练。

Result: 提出的方法在多个图像数据集上的实验评估表现出色，性能提升超过2.5倍，解释器的训练速度可以提高两个数量级。

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley significantly improves the efficiency and performance of Shapley value computations for training data.

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: Reservoir computing with a novel training method can generalize across multiple basins in dynamical systems without requiring structural priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning struggles to generalize to underrepresented dynamics without structural priors, so there is a need for methods that can achieve generalization without them.

Method: The paper introduces a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers.

Result: Reservoir computers trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can generalize to capture system behavior in unobserved basins.

Conclusion: Reservoir computing can achieve out-of-domain generalization by learning from multiple trajectories, even without explicit structural priors.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

Conclusion: 单一Transformer架构能够在没有任务先验知识的情况下解决多任务问题。

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

TL;DR: SiftAttention is a novel approximate attention method that improves inference efficiency on GPUs by reducing memory overhead and preserving model quality without relying on inefficient top-k operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of memory bandwidth limitations during inference on GPUs, particularly in attention computations between HBM and SRAM, and to improve the efficiency of approximate attention methods without relying on top-k operations.

Method: The proposed method, SiftAttention, replaces top-k operations in approximate attention with a computationally efficient element-wise filtering operation using a dynamically estimated threshold value for attention scores.

Result: SiftAttention effectively reduces data movement between HBM and SRAM, maintaining model quality and improving efficiency compared to current methods.

Conclusion: SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing approximate attention methods and reduces memory bandwidth usage during inference.

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了自组织系统能够同时自组织到多重临界状态，提供了理解诸如大脑等系统多相变行为的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨自组织临界状态中的动态行为，尤其是系统同时自组织到多重不同类型的临界状态的可能性。

Method: 本文研究了一种耦合振荡器在随机网络上的模型，其中网络的拓扑结构会随着振荡器的动态变化而演变。

Result: 系统首先自组织到振荡的起点，然后逐渐转向图案形成的起点，同时仍保持在振荡的起点，从而在两个不同的方面同时达到临界状态。

Conclusion: 这个研究展示了系统可以自组织到多重临界状态，同时保持在另一临界状态的边缘，这是一个普遍的行为，可能会广泛存在于自组织系统中。

Abstract: Self-organized criticality is a well-established phenomenon, where a system
dynamically tunes its structure to operate on the verge of a phase transition.
Here, we show that the dynamics inside the self-organized critical state are
fundamentally far more versatile than previously recognized, to the extent that
a system can self-organize to a new type of phase transition while staying on
the verge of another. In this first demonstration of self-organization to
multicriticality, we investigate a model of coupled oscillators on a random
network, where the network topology evolves in response to the oscillator
dynamics. We show that the system first self-organizes to the onset of
oscillations, after which it drifts to the onset of pattern formation while
still remaining at the onset of oscillations, thus becoming critical in two
different ways at once. The observed evolution to multicriticality is robust
generic behavior that we expect to be widespread in self-organizing systems.
Overall, these results offer a unifying framework for studying systems, such as
the brain, where multiple phase transitions may be relevant for proper
functioning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于扩散的动漫素描自动上色方法，使用SSIMBaD来保证更均衡的视觉重建，实验结果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖于预定义的噪声计划，常常损害感知一致性。

Method: 提出了一种基于扩散的框架来自动为动漫风格的面部素描上色，称为SSIMBaD，通过持续时间的扩散模型引入了SSIMBaD，并应用了sigma空间的转换。

Result: 实验表明，这种方法在大型动漫面部数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在像素准确度和感知质量上优于最先进的模型，并且能够泛化到不同风格。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

Motivation: 评估现有用于测量由大型语言模型引发的代表性伤害的工具，是否符合从业者在实际操作中的需求。

Method: 通过半结构化访谈收集数据，分析12位从业者的反馈，以评估现有测量工具在实践中的使用情况及其有效性。

Result: 研究发现现有测量工具普遍无法满足评估需求，主要由于测量工具与从业者的需求不匹配，以及实践和制度上的障碍限制了工具的使用。

Conclusion: 通过借鉴测量理论和实用测量理论，提出了针对评估LLM系统的工具存在的挑战的解决方案建议，以更好地满足实践者的需求。

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

Result: 发现监督机制需要在三个方面加强：持续监督，加强治理与运营能力的整合，跨部门协调

Conclusion: 现有的公共部门监督机制在应对代理型AI系统带来的挑战时，因此需要改进和调整其监督结构

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-n-Val enhances synthetic data generation by using LLM and VLLM agents, significantly improving validation and performance in computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of data scarcity and label noise in computer vision by improving the quality of synthetic data generation.

Method: Gen-n-Val employs two agents: the LD prompt agent (an LLM) to optimize prompts for generating single-object masks, and the data validation agent (a VLLM) to filter low-quality data, with improvements guided through TextGrad.

Result: Gen-n-Val reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7%, improves rare class performance by 1% mAP on COCO with YOLO models, and shows 7.1% mAP improvement in open-vocabulary detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val significantly enhances the quality and performance of synthetic data in computer vision tasks by utilizing LLMs and VLLMs to validate and optimize data generation processes.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

TL;DR: RSVP通过视觉提示的推理分割框架，实现了多模态推理与视觉理解的结合，显著提升了分割任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在推理能力上表现出色，但缺乏视觉锚定和分割机制，从而造成认知推理与视觉感知之间的差距。

Method: 提出一个名为"Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting (RSVP)"的框架，通过两个阶段（推理阶段和分割阶段）将多步骤多模态推理与视觉理解相结合。

Result: RSVP在ReasonSeg上超越最先进的方法达+6.5 gIoU和+9.2 cIoU，并在SegInW的零样本设置下达到49.7 mAP的表现。

Conclusion: RSVP作为一个有效且可扩展的框架，成功地将认知推理与结构化视觉理解相结合。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了首个多模态多图像推理基准（MMRB），涵盖92个子任务，通过基线实验显示开源MLLM显著落后于商业MLLM，奖励模型在多图像任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）基准测试主要集中于单一图像的视觉推理或多图像理解任务中对最终答案的评估，而对于多个图像输入的推理能力探索不足。

Method: 引入了多模态多图像推理基准测试（MMRB），这是首个旨在评估多个图像间结构化视觉推理的基准测试。MMRB包括92个子任务，涵盖空间、时间和语义推理，使用GPT-4o生成并由人类专家优化的多解决方案CoT样式注释。还设计了一个派生子集，用于评估多图像场景中的多模态奖励模型。为了支持快速和可扩展的评估，提出了一种使用开源LLM的句子级匹配框架。

Result: 广泛的基线实验表明，开源MLLM在多图像推理任务中显著落后于商业MLLM。此外，当前的多模态奖励模型几乎无法处理多图像奖励排名任务。

Conclusion: 新提出的基准（MMRB）填补了现有MLLM评估中多图像推理能力方面的空白，展示了开源模型与商业模型之间的差距，强调了多模态奖励模型在多图像推理任务中表现的不足。

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

Method: 进行了8个多模态大规模语言模型的评估和一个包含3名放射科住院医师的人类读者研究。

Result: MedGemma模型取得了83.24%的总体准确率，人类读者的最佳成绩为77.27%。

Conclusion: ReXVQA展示了AI在胸部X光片解释上已超越人类专家的能力，其最佳模式MedGemma优于放射科住院医师。

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be
open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXVQA

Motivation: 目前的方法忽视了球员行为带来的强烈上下文线索，而这些是重要的冰球位置指示。基于此，提出了一种新的冰球定位方法。

Method: 该研究提出了PLUCC方法，包括三个组件：上下文编码器、特征金字塔编码器和门控解码器，并引入了基于同射几何的RSLE评价指标。

Result: 在PuckDataset数据集上的实验结果显示，PLUCC在检测性能上优于之前的基线方法，平均精度提升12.2%，RSLE平均精度达到25%。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，上下文理解在提高冰球检测性能中的关键作用，对自动化体育分析有广泛影响。

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

Motivation: 为了更好地理解人类视觉系统与深度神经网络（DNN）之间的相似性，以及DNN对视觉刺激的脑响应预测的具体特征。

Method: 利用一种称为激活最大化的技术对基于DNN的脑编码模型进行分析，并提取多个层次的信息进行线性回归以预测大脑的fMRI响应。之后生成针对单个皮层体素优化的图像，并验证其在fMRI研究中的有效性。

Result: 发现生成的图像能够在特定区域驱动脑活动，并且在实验参与者中跨越低级和高级视觉区域呈现一致性。

Conclusion: 成功应用激活最大化技术于基于DNN的编码模型，可以灵活地描述和调节人类视觉系统的响应。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

TL;DR: HMAR是一种新的图像生成算法，通过解决VAR的瓶颈，提供更高质量的图像和更快的采样，并支持灵活的采样调度和零样本图像编辑。


<details>

Motivation: 解决VAR在并行生成过程中图像质量下降、序列长度随图像分辨率超线性增长以及采样调度需要重新训练的问题。

Method: HMAR通过下一尺度预测和遮罩预测生成高质量图像，使用马尔可夫过程来改进尺度预测，并在预测过程中采取多步遮罩生成程序。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256和512x512基准测试中，HMAR模型匹配或超越了参数匹配的VAR、扩散、和自回归基线；实现了训练和推理时间相较于VAR加速超过2.5x和1.75x，同时推理内存占用降低超过3x。

Conclusion: HMAR在高质量图像生成和快速采样方面显著优于VAR，具有更低的推理内存占用，并可以进行零样本图像编辑任务。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

Motivation: 现有方法通常假设使用设备的视觉惯性测程系统估计的帧率6DoF姿态，可能忽略像素级准确重建所需的关键细节。

Method: 本研究提出使用视觉惯性捆绑调整（VIBA）以校准滚动快门RGB传感相机的精确时间戳和运动，结合物理图像成像模型并应用于高斯斑点表示的变体，对其进行了全面的评估。

Conclusion: 本文通过在高动态范围条件下对场景进行照片级逼真重建，提出了利用视觉惯性捆绑调整来校准RGB传感相机的精确时间戳和运动，及结合物理图像成像模型以有效解决传感器特性的问题，显著增强了重建效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and

representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了HoliSafe数据集和SafeLLaVA模型，用于增强视觉语言模型的安全性并揭示现有模型的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉语言模型在安全性方面仍存在漏洞，尤其是图像和文本交互可能导致不安全内容，以及数据驱动的调整方法缺乏结构性的创新。

Method: 引入一个全面的安全数据集和基准测试——HoliSafe，包括五种安全和不安全图像-文本组合。提出了SafeLLaVA，包含一个可学习的安全元标记和专用安全头，以加强模型的内在安全性。

Result: SafeLLaVA在多个视觉语言模型基准测试中表现出色，取得了最新的安全性能。同时，HoliSafe基准揭示了现有模型的重要漏洞。

Conclusion: HoliSafe和SafeLLaVA不仅提高了视觉语言模型的安全性能，还揭示了现有模型的漏洞，并可能推动相关领域的更多研究。

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在视觉语言模型（VLLM）中，图像概念在隐藏激活中的表示方式。

Method: 通过在线性可解码特征的基础上，训练多模态稀疏自动编码器（SAEs），以创建一个可解释的文本和图像特征词典。

Result: 发现了通过模型产出的有针对性的编辑，特征是因果关系，并且在残差流中存在多种ImageNet类的特征。

Conclusion: 在LlaVA-Next模型中，尽管跨模态的模型表示差异较大，但在更深的层次中，它们的共享程度增加。

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Abstract: This paper presents an AI-assisted auto-labeling system for display panel

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种在不增加计算复杂度的情况下提高水下图像增强效果的方法。

Method: 使用一种新颖的双流架构，通过将Jaffe-McGlamery物理模型与基于胶囊聚类的特征表示学习结合来增强水下图像。方法包括物理估计器和胶囊聚类用于特征提取。

Result: 与现有计算复杂度相似的方法相比，PSNR指标提升超过1 dB；与最佳现有方法相比，PSNR提升0.5 dB，且计算复杂度降低为其三分之一。

Conclusion: 提出的双流架构在多项基准测试中显示出超过现有最佳方法的持续改进，且计算复杂度仅为其三分之一。

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

TL;DR: 提出RAP方法，通过仅使用9.3%的数据提高MLLM的多模态推理能力，减少43%计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战大规模多模态语言模型中认为广泛的训练数据是提高多模态推理能力的必要条件这一假设。

Method: 我们引入了一种新的数据选择范式，称为推理激活潜力（RAP），通过两个互补估计器识别认知样本：因果差异估计器（CDE）和注意力置信度估计器（ACE）。此外，我们还引入了一个难度感知替换模块（DRM）以替换简单实例为具有认知挑战性的实例。

Result: 实验表明，RAP方法在六个数据集上使用更少的数据获得了更好的性能，并且显著减少了计算成本。

Conclusion: 我们的RAP方法通过使用仅占训练数据9.3%的数据，显著提高了性能，同时减少了43%以上的计算成本。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

TL;DR: 研究引入了一种结合视觉和语言模型的多模态框架，旨在更好地评估街道的主观和客观特征，提高城市设计的包容性并提供实用的城市规划工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的城市分析方法不能充分捕捉城市设计所需的主观感知，因此引入新的方法来提升包容性城市设计的有效性。

Method: 引入了多模态街道评估框架(MSEF)，该框架结合了视觉变压器(VisualGLM-6B)与大型语言模型(GPT-4)，通过LoRA和P-Tuning v2进行参数高效调整。同时使用了来自中国哈尔滨的超过15,000张街景图像进行微调和验证。

Result: 模型在客观特征上的F1评分为0.84，并且居民感知一致性达到89.3%，呈现跨越不同社会经济地理的有效性，并揭示线性和语义依赖模式。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了融合视觉变压器(VisualGLM-6B)和大型语言模型(GPT-4)的多模态街道评估框架(MSEF)，通过景观图像的注释和居民感知数据，实现对街道的可解释双输出评估，从而提升城市规划的包容性。

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

TL;DR: CIVET framework evaluates VLMs, revealing their limitations in recognizing object properties and relations, underperforming compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the understanding of VLMs regarding object properties and relations in scenes.

Method: The study introduces CIVET, a framework for evaluating VLMs using controlled stimuli, reducing bias and noise.

Result: Findings show limitations in VLMs' abilities to accurately recognize complex object properties and relations, with performance relying on object positioning, and subpar compared to humans.

Conclusion: VLMs can recognize only basic object properties and struggle with understanding object relations, performing below human-level accuracy.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just
individual animal re-identification.

TL;DR: AbBiBench是一种评估抗体结合亲和力成熟与设计的新框架，侧重于抗体-抗原复合体的功能性。研究发现结构条件逆折叠模型在亲和力关联和生成任务中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的抗体评价策略仅关注抗体本身及其与天然抗体的相似性，而没有考虑抗体-抗原复合体(Antibody-Antigen complex)的功能性。为了弥补这一空白，我们引入了AbBiBench框架，用于评估抗体设计与特定抗原结合的潜力。

Method: 建立和共享9个数据集，包含9个抗原及155,853个重链突变抗体，以对比分析14种蛋白模型，包括掩蔽语言模型、自回归语言模型、逆折叠模型、基于扩散的生成模型及几何图模型。实验通过模型对复合体的可能性评估来比较模型表现，并进行案例研究来验证模型生成能力。

Result: 结构条件逆折叠模型在亲和力关联和生成任务中表现优于其他模型。Top-performing模型能够更有效地在结构完整性和生物物理特性上排序新抗体，展示了其生成新抗体的能力。

Conclusion: AbBiBench框架提供了一个统一并具有生物学基础的评估框架，有助于开发更加有效且具功能意识的抗体设计模型。它使得抗体结合亲和力成熟与设计过程的评估更加生物学导向。

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

*Salil Patel*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个潜在空间理论框架，将不同类型的医疗数据统一到一个共享空间中，以提供个性化的诊断和治疗。尽管面临挑战，但这个框架可能推动临床实践的个性化发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于医疗数据类型多样且复杂，这些数据虽然在表面上看似不同，但实际上许多数据编码了相同的生理状态信息。因此，迫切需要一个框架来统一解释这些异质性证据，并提供个性化医疗诊断和治疗的量化标准。

Method: 论文采用了潜在空间假设，将不同的医疗数据视作统一生理状态的投影，构建了一个学习到的几何表示空间，能够描述个体的健康状态、疾病进展轨迹以及治疗干预。其中，疾病进程被描述为这一空间内的轨迹，而治疗干预被表示为导向向量。

Result: 该理论框架揭示了疾病演变的子轨迹和患者特定的改变方向，有助于解决以往受到疾病名称掩盖的多种病理生理实体问题，并发现涉及更广泛解剖领域的可能性。此外，该框架支持个性化的诊断、纵向监控和量身定制的治疗。

Conclusion: 论文详细描述了一种基于潜在空间的理论框架，可以通过将不同医疗数据映射到一个统一的几何表示空间中，从而揭示疾病的潜在轨迹。这一框架有助于个性化诊断、监测和治疗，推动临床实践从传统的分类方式向更加精细的个体化轨迹过渡。尽管仍存在如偏差放大、稀有病种数据稀缺、隐私问题和因果关系划分等挑战，但通过对规模感知编码器、纵向数据流上的持续学习以及基于扰动的验证方法的进一步研究，这些问题有望得到解决。

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

Conclusion: 通过结合多臂老虎机算法进行团队组建及使用大型语言模型提供个性化反馈，可以提高团队的满意度、凝聚力和表现。

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

*Oliver G. S. Lundqvist,Fabricio Oliveira*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 研究简化了使用神经网络解决最优控制问题的方法，不需要将成本函数纳入训练，通过较简单的神经算子架构和优化例程即可实现，方法在多种问题中的效果准确且一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统使用神经网络解决最优控制问题的方法结合了数据、微分方程残差和目标成本的损失函数。研究人员发现训练过程中包含成本函数是不必要的，期望通过简化架构和精简方法，提升效率。

Method: 研究采用了一种简单的神经算子架构（如DeepONet）结合无约束优化例程。通过使用训练的神经算子在迭代优化例程中，根据微分方程残差在成本函数中添加惩罚项，来计算相对于控制的梯度。

Result: 该方法在九个不同的最优控制问题上进行了验证，通过训练三个独立的DeepONet模型，每个模型对应一个不同的微分方程。每个模型解决三个具有不同成本函数的问题，并在所有案例中表现出准确且一致的性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，简单的神经算子架构与一个无约束优化程序结合，可以通过单一的物理信息训练阶段和后续的优化阶段解决多个最优控制问题。此外，简化的训练过程中无需将成本函数纳入其中。

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

Conclusion: 该研究表明，Parler TTS 模型能够从具有挑战性的数据分布中学习生成语音，但在智能控制和保持一致的语者身份方面存在困难。

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the

TL;DR: The study compares joint speech-text decoding strategies and introduces an early-stop interleaved pattern, improving alignment and speed, while curated QA datasets enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore effective speech-text jointly decoding paradigms for improving the performance, efficiency, and alignment quality of speech language models in spoken dialogue systems.

Method: Systematic comparison of joint speech-text decoding strategies with controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech tokenizer, and training data.

Result: The early-stop interleaved (ESI) pattern accelerates decoding and yields better performance. Also, high-quality QA datasets enhance speech QA performance.

Conclusion: Interleaved approach achieves the best alignment but is hindered by slow inference. The proposed early-stop interleaved (ESI) pattern improves both speed and performance.

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

Method: 本文进行了大规模比较，评估了13种去偏方法在多标签语音情感识别中的效果。这些方法包括预处理、正则化、对抗学习、偏见学习者和分布式鲁棒优化。

Result: 实验表明，在性别不平衡的情况下，一些去偏方法可以有效地减少性别表现差异，并且不影响模型整体性能。本研究提供了有关选择有效去偏策略的可操作性见解。

Conclusion: 本文得出的结论是，在多标签情境下，某些去偏方法能有效减少性别偏差，同时不会导致整体模型性能的下降。

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However,
the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in such
multi-label scenarios remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present
EMO-Debias, a large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to
multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing,
regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally
robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion
datasets, using WavLM and XLSR representations, evaluate each method under
conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender
performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings
provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and
highlight the impact of dataset distributions.

TL;DR: cGSA is an AI-driven framework that improves gene set analysis by incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization, showing over 30% improvement over baseline methods and demonstrated effectiveness in melanoma and breast cancer cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional gene set analysis methods often overlook the clinical context, resulting in nonspecific or irrelevant pathway lists that require manual effort to interpret, reducing reliability and reproducibility.

Method: cGSA integrates AI-driven techniques such as gene cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to enhance pathway prioritization in gene set analysis, taking into account both statistical significance and biological meaning.

Result: Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases shows that cGSA outperforms traditional methods by over 30%. Expert validation confirms its precision and interpretability. Independent case studies demonstrate its effectiveness in providing context-specific insights in melanoma and breast cancer.

Conclusion: cGSA significantly improves the reliability and interpretability of genomic data analysis by prioritizing pathways that are both statistically significant and biologically meaningful, outperforming conventional methods by over 30%.

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

Motivation: 许多定性研究生成的数据没有得到充分利用，计算方法可以重新利用这些数据。

Conclusion: 计算方法可以有效利用过去定性研究生成的数据。

Abstract: This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in
reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative
inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the
development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key
challenges and ongoing concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and
reuse.

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为Exp4Fuse的融合排序框架，通过零样本LLM查询扩展提升稀疏检索性能，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM生成的文件质量不佳，导致查询扩展方法的效能有限，成本和计算密集度高。

Method: 引入一种新颖的融合排序框架Exp4Fuse，通过间接应用零样本LLM-based查询扩展来提高稀疏检索器的性能。

Result: 实验结果表明Exp4Fuse不仅在提高稀疏检索器方面优于现有方法，还与先进的稀疏检索器结合时，在多个基准测试上达到了SOTA结果。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse在改进稀疏检索方面表现优异，优于现有的LLM-based查询扩展方法，并在多个基准测试中达到了SOTA结果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

TL;DR: GOLFer通过使用小型开放源语言模型，结合幻觉过滤和文档组合技术，提供了一种更高效的查询扩展方法，并在性能上超越或匹敌大型模型的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大型语言模型的查询扩展方法由于模型规模带来的高成本、资源密集和有限的可获得性面临局限。GOLFer旨在解决这些局限，通过利用较小规模的开放源语言模型实现更为高效的查询扩展。

Method: 我们推出了名为GOLFer的方法，包括两个模块：幻觉过滤器和文档组合器。幻觉过滤器负责检测并去除生成文档中的非事实和不一致句子，而文档组合器则使用权重向量将过滤后的内容与查询结合，以平衡其影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，GOLFer在使用较小规模语言模型的情况下，一直优于其他方法，并且在与使用大规模语言模型的方法的竞争中维持了竞争力，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: GOLFer通过利用较小规模的开放源语言模型进行查询扩展，不仅在性能上超越了其他方法，还在与大型语言模型的方法竞争时表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper addresses memory issues in document retrieval by optimizing token merging, resulting in Light-ColPali/ColQwen2, which significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the excessive memory usage in Visualized Document Retrieval caused by ColPali/ColQwen2's multiple patch-level embeddings for each page.

Method: The study investigates two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging, to reduce patch embeddings per page with minimum performance loss. It develops Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 using token merging for optimal efficiency.

Result: Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance and reduces memory usage to 11.8% of the original. Additionally, it retains 94.6% effectiveness at just a 2.8% memory footprint.

Conclusion: Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 provides efficient document retrieval with limited memory usage, maintaining substantial retrieval performance.

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen
in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate
simulation that can aid in the development of neural networks, large scale

Abstract: Memory effects play a crucial role in social interactions and decision-making

opinion dynamics model to characterize the memory effects in system states.
Building upon the Hegselmann-Krause framework and fractional-order difference,
a comprehensive model is established that captures the persistent influence of
historical information. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, the fundamental
properties including convergence and consensus is investigated. The results
demonstrate that the proposed model not only maintains favorable convergence
and consensus characteristics compared to classical opinion dynamics, but also
addresses limitations such as the monotonicity of bounded opinions. This
enables a more realistic representation of opinion evolution in real-world
scenarios. The findings of this study provide new insights and methodological
approaches for understanding opinion formation and evolution, offering both

Motivation: 量化整数规划（QIP）扩展了量化布尔公式（QBF）和整数规划，通过变量量化提供了一个解决复杂决策场景的通用框架，并且能够有效建模多阶段鲁棒离散线性优化问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于扩展的方法，该方法使用反例引导抽象精化（CEGAR），并适应QBF中的技术。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在特定情况下表现出优于现有基于搜索的QIP解算器的性能，并且在使用线性约束模拟问题时，与最先进的基于扩展的QBF解算器相比表现出了显著的性能优势。

Conclusion: 通过引入一种基于扩展的方法，量化整数规划（QIP）解决不确定性优化问题的能力得到了显着提升。在具体实例中表现出优于现有基于搜索的QIP解算器的性能。

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable
performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉语言模型(VLMs)在准确理解复杂3D场景和动态推理动作指示位置方面仍然存在不足，故提出RoboRefer来提升这些方面的能力。

Method: 通过引入监督精细调优（SFT）结合一个专门的深度编码器来实现精确的3D空间理解；使用强化精细调优（RFT）结合度量敏感的过程奖励函数，进行一般化多步骤空间推理。

Result: SFT训练的RoboRefer在空间理解方面达到了89.6%的平均成功率，RFT训练的RoboRefer在RefSpatial-Bench上的平均准确率相较于其他基线提高了17.4%。

Conclusion: RoboRefer通过两种精细调优技术，实现了对3D场景的精确空间理解和一般化的多步骤空间推理，在RefSpatial-Bench上超越了所有基线，表现优异。

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Motivation: 现有的音频文本模型在背景声源存在的情况下表现会显著下降，尤其是在信噪比低的情况下，需要一种方法来改善这一问题。

Method: 研究提出了一种量化和整合背景声源贡献的方法，以改进分类过程，同时采用了一种领域适应技术提高在不同背景和信噪比条件下的准确性。

Result: 所提方法提升了音频文本模型在不同背景和信噪比条件下的分类准确性，并展示了在各种最先进的原型方法中的通用性、可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新颖的方法，能够在不需要重新训练模型的情况下，提高环境声音分类的性能，特别是在有背景声源存在的情况下。

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

Motivation: 为了克服以往方法简单微调预训练ASR模型作为标签的不足，实现语音、标签和字素之间的并行数据，用于文本到语音转换和口音估计等各种任务。

Method: 采用两种方法在标签生成过程中与相应字素进行条件关联：通过使用预训练的BERT特征的提示编码器进行隐式字素条件化；在推理过程中明确修剪与字素不一致的标签假设。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高字素与预测标签之间的一致性，并且在口音估计任务中的创建的并行数据有效提高了估算准确性。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型能够显著提高语音标签与字素之间的一致性，并且在口音估计任务中有效提高估算准确性。

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出的 LLM-P2G 解码框架在跨语言 ASR 中优于传统 WFST 系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于音素的多语言预训练和跨语言微调具有数据效率高和较好的结果，但现有的WFST解码在复杂的解码流程和无法利用大语言模型上存在局限性。因此，我们尝试通过 LLM-P2G 解码来克服这些限制。

Method: 我们提出了基于大语言模型(LLM)的音素到字母(P2G)解码框架，用于音素为基础的 ASR。该框架包括语音到音素(S2P)和音素到字母(P2G)两个阶段的解码。

Result: LLM-P2G 在波兰语和德语的跨语言ASR任务中，相较于 WFST 系统取得了相对错误率降低的成绩，波兰语降低了3.6%，德语降低了6.9%。

Conclusion: LLM-P2G 在跨语言的 ASR 表现优于 WFST 系统，特别是在波兰语和德语中。

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过分析注意力模式来检测和过滤恶意段落的算法，但更隐蔽的攻击仍能实现较高成功率，显示改进现有防御方法的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的攻击在设计上不够隐蔽，容易被可靠的检测和降低，因此研究提出了需要攻击者仔细分析生成过程中的中间信号以避免明显的操控痕迹。

Method: 提出一种基于注意力模式的过滤算法，即注意力方差过滤算法，该算法使用归一化的段落注意力分数（Normalized Passage Attention Score）来识别和过滤潜在的恶意段落。

Result: 通过使用注意力模式识别恶意段落，新的算法能够将现有攻击的成功率降低20%，而针对更隐蔽的自适应攻击，攻击成功率达到35%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，现有的基于注意力的防御虽然有效，但存在被更隐蔽的自适应攻击绕过的风险，提示了增强防御机制的必要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

TL;DR: 研究提出了使用差分隐私的微调框架，通过在微调过程中加入噪声来保护敏感医疗数据的隐私，取得了与非隐私基线相当的分类性能，验证了效用与隐私的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一个框架通过加入校准噪声在微调过程中降低与敏感患者数据相关的隐私风险，同时维护分类性能，从而在放射报告文本上进行多异常分类。

Method: 研究使用差分隐私的低秩适应（DP-LoRA）方法，对大型语言模型进行微调以进行多异常分类。在高隐私和中等隐私的情况下（隐私预算范围为：{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}），使用MIMIC-CXR和CT-RATE数据集中的数据进行微调。

Result: 在两种不同数据集和三种不同模型上进行的实验显示了显著的隐私与效用之间的权衡。在中等隐私保障下，这些经过差分隐私微调的模型在MIMIC-CXR数据集上达到加权F1评分0.88，在CT-RATE数据集上达到0.59，而非隐私的LoRA基线分别为0.90和0.78。

Conclusion: 通过使用LoRA进行微调，差分隐私技术能够有效且隐私安全地从放射报告中进行多异常分类，解决了在敏感医疗数据上微调大型语言模型的关键挑战。

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

*Xuhao Ren,Haotian Liang,Yajie Wang,Chuan Zhang,Zehui Xiong,Liehuang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BESA改进编码器窃取攻击，通过检测和恢复扰动，提高面对防御时的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于扰动的防御下，编码器窃取攻击的表现受到阻碍，因此提出BESA以克服这些防御。

Method: BESA由两个模块组成：扰动检测和扰动恢复，可以与经典的编码器窃取攻击结合。扰动检测模块利用目标编码器获取的特征向量来推断服务提供商采用的防御机制。检测到防御机制后，扰动恢复模块利用精心设计的生成模型将被扰动的特征矢量恢复为干净的特征矢量。

Result: 基于多种数据集的广泛评估表明，BESA在面对最先进的防御和多重防御组合时显著提高了代理编码器的准确性。

Conclusion: BESA大幅提升了现有编码器窃取攻击在面对最先进防御和多重防御组合时的代理编码器准确率，最高提升达24.63%。

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代计算环境的复杂性和网络威胁的不断升级，需要更加稳健、自适应和自动化的安全执行方式。

Method: 本文采用了一种结合上下文学习和检索增强生成（RAG）的创新框架。此框架通过将工具和API规范收集并存储在向量数据库中，以便高效地检索相关信息。

Result: 实验证明，使用RAG方法相比非RAG基线，可显著改善精度、召回率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 该论文证明了利用RAG方法可以显著提高攻击缓解策略的实施效率和准确性。

Abstract: The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing
sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a more robust, adaptive, and
automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context
learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how
our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

TL;DR: 通过创建hdl2v数据集，显著提升大模型在Verilog代码生成上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于可公开获取的Verilog代码量远少于Python等软件语言，因此需要增加Verilog代码的数据量以增强语言模型在生成Verilog代码上的表现。

Method: 创建名为hdl2v的数据集，通过将VHDL、Chisel和PyMTL3等硬件描述语言转换或编译为Verilog来增加可用的人写Verilog数据量。

Result: 在VerilogEvalV2中，通过不使用任何数据增强或知识提炼，将一个320亿参数开源模型的性能提高了高达23%（pass@10）。此外，通过数据增强的微调方法性能提升达63%。

Conclusion: 通过将其他硬件描述语言转换为Verilog来增加Verilog数据量，从而提升大语言模型生成Verilog代码的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better
performance.

TL;DR: 开发了一种新的去噪方法，可加速和提高MC剂量计算的准确性，并在不同类型癌症中显示出良好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMPT为头颈部癌症提供精确的肿瘤覆盖，并避免暴露于危险器官。然而，由于其对解剖变化的敏感性，需要频繁适应快速准确的蒙特卡罗剂量计算，因此有必要加速MC计算以使高质量的剂量生成变得更快。

Method: 开发了一种基于扩散变压器的去噪框架。使用来自80名头颈部患者的IMPT计划和3D CT图像，通过MC方程生成噪声和高统计剂量图。数据标准化、零填充、归一化，并转化为准高斯分布。模型以噪声剂量图和CT图像作为输入，高统计剂量图作为真实值进行训练，使用了MSE、残差损失和区域MAE的组合损失进行优化。

Result: 模型在头颈部、肺、乳腺和前列腺癌病例中分别达到了0.195、0.120、0.172和0.376 Gy[RBE]的MAE值。所有部位的3D伽马通过率均超过92%。CTVs和OARs的DVH指数与真实值非常接近。

Conclusion: 开发的基于扩散变压器的去噪框架在只用头颈部数据训练的情况下，在多个疾病部位表现出了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

Motivation: 现有的方法需要具有深厚BGP知识的专家来解释事件并提出改进方案，因而提出一种能够增强事件解释性和分析精度的自动化解决方案。

Method: BEAR框架使用大型语言模型（LLMs）通过多步骤推理过程将BGP表格数据翻译成详细的文本叙述，并结合合成数据生成框架来评估其有效性。

Result: 通过对真实和合成数据集的评估，BEAR实现了100%的准确率，优于链式思维和上下文学习基线。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种名为BEAR的框架，能够利用大型语言模型自动生成解释BGP异常事件的详细报告，从而提供宝贵的网络管理运营洞察。

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70
articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and
explore its potential for monetization.
