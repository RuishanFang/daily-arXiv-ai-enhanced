TL;DR: 针对生成AI在文本、图像和音频上的自动评估缺乏系统框架的问题，本文提出了一个分类方法并分析了五个基本范式，促进了跨模式评估研究的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前虽然有多种自动评估方法，但缺乏一个系统的框架来全面组织这些方法以应对生成输出的质量评估挑战。

Method: 通过审查现有的自动评估方法，确定五种基本范式，并对文本、图像和音频生成的评估方法进行分析和比较。

Result: 开发了一套综合性的审查和统一分类法，能够广泛适用于文本、图像和音频生成的自动评估，为未来的跨模式评估研究指明了方向。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一套系统的框架和统一的分类法，以组织生成内容的自动评估方法，涵盖文本、图像和音频三种模式。这促进了跨模式评估方法的研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

TL;DR: TaskCraft系统自动生成可扩展的多工具代理任务，有效改善AI任务优化，并提供36000个不同难度的数据集进行测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令数据缺乏工具交互，当前代理基准需要昂贵的人类标注，限制了其扩展性。

Method: 引入TaskCraft自动化流程，利用深度和宽度扩展原子任务，生成具有难度可调、支持多工具、可验证的代理任务。

Result: TaskCraft产生了约36,000个不同难度的大规模合成任务数据集，为未来的代理调整和评估研究提供支持。

Conclusion: TaskCraft能够生成具有多种工具和可验证执行轨迹的任务，改善了生成流程中的提示优化，并增强了代理基础模型的监督微调。

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，通过语义Bell不等式测试，模糊词对的语言解释显现出非经典上下文性，建议使用贝叶斯风格的重复采样来更有效地分析语言意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义退化是自然语言的基本属性，LLM和现代NLP系统存在的局限性主要是由于自然语言的解释约束。研究进行探讨，以找出语言形式及其理解之间的关系。

Method: 使用多样的LLM代理作为“计算认知系统”进行语义Bell不等式测试，以在不同上下文设置下解释模糊词对。

Result: 实验中，平均CHSH期望值从1.2到2.8不等，其中某些运行结果（例如，2.3-2.4）显著违反经典边界（|S|≤2）。这表明在模糊情况下，语言解释可能表现出非经典的上下文性，与人类认知实验结果一致。

Conclusion: 通过使用Kolmogorov复杂性分析，该研究表明随着表达复杂性增加，无论是人类还是基于LLM的AI系统都难以恢复单一的预期意义，说明语言形式本身具备意义的传统观点存在缺陷。建议采用观察者依赖的解释行为来实现意义。

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize the generation and validation process of FMEA documents for industrial assets, addressing existing challenges in industrial equipment monitoring.

Method: The method involves multiple LLM-based agents with specific roles, dynamic task routing, and iterative content refinement through multi-persona-driven discussions.

Result: The research shows improved interaction and validation processes in FMEA document generation through the use of Chat-of-Thought system, effectively addressing industry-specific challenges.

Conclusion: Chat-of-Thought demonstrates significant potential in facilitating FMEA document generation through its multi-agent system and innovative collaborative techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel multi-agent system called Chat-of-Thought,
designed to facilitate the generation of Failure Modes and Effects Analysis
(FMEA) documents for industrial assets. Chat-of-Thought employs multiple
collaborative Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with specific roles,
leveraging advanced AI techniques and dynamic task routing to optimize the
generation and validation of FMEA tables. A key innovation in this system is
the introduction of a Chat of Thought, where dynamic, multi-persona-driven
discussions enable iterative refinement of content. This research explores the
application domain of industrial equipment monitoring, highlights key
challenges, and demonstrates the potential of Chat-of-Thought in addressing
these challenges through interactive, template-driven workflows and
context-aware agent collaboration.

### [5] [When Meaning Stays the Same, but Models Drift: Evaluating Quality of Service under Token-Level Behavioral Instability in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10095)
*Xiao Li,Joel Kreuzwieser,Alan Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在语义上等效但词汇不同的提示下会表现出一致的响应变化，提出了PBSS框架来测量此类变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在响应不同提示时表现不同，这些提示在语义上是等同的，但在词汇层面有所不同。研究这种现象（我们称为提示差异），可以揭示LLMs在语义等效的提示重构下的行为漂移。

Method: 提出了提示语义转移（PBSS）作为一种诊断框架，用于测量LLMs在语义等效提示重构下的行为漂移。

Result: PBSS被应用于十项受限任务中，显示出一致的、模型特定的响应变化，表明这种变化与标记化和解码的统计规律有关。

Conclusion: 研究结果指出，在重构过程下模型评价稳定性被忽视，而标记策略和解码机制可能导致训练后服务质量的不稳定性。

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

### [6] [ChartReasoner: Code-Driven Modality Bridging for Long-Chain Reasoning in Chart Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10116)
*Caijun Jia,Nan Xu,Jingxuan Wei,Qingli Wang,Lei Wang,Bihui Yu,Junnan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ChartReasoner，一个针对图表推理的两阶段框架，利用ECharts代码转换和数据合成提升模型性能，与先进开源模型相比，以更少的参数实现相当的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长链推理上显示出显著能力，但如何将这种能力扩展到视觉推理任务上仍是一个挑战。现有多模态推理方法将视觉推理任务转换为纯文本推理，但常常丢失嵌入在可视化中的关键信息，尤其对于诸如图表问答这类需要大量视觉细节的任务。

Method: ChartReasoner采用一个两阶段框架。首先训练高保真模型，将多样化的图表图像转换为结构化的ECharts代码，尽可能保持布局和数据语义。然后设计了一条通用的图表推理数据合成管道，利用预训练的模型自动生成图表推理轨迹，并使用代码验证器过滤掉低质量样本。最终通过监督微调和强化学习在合成的数据集上训练多模态模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，ChartReasoner能够以较少的参数保持图表原始细节，效果与最先进的开源模型相当，并在领域外的表现接近专有系统。

Conclusion: ChartReasoner展示了在保持原始图表细节的同时，以较少的参数实现与先进开源模型相当的性能，在超出领域的应用中接近专有系统如GPT-4o的表现。

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

*Jiaxin Wen,Zachary Ankner,Arushi Somani,Peter Hase,Samuel Marks,Jacob Goldman-Wetzler,Linda Petrini,Henry Sleight,Collin Burns,He He,Shi Feng,Ethan Perez,Jan Leike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 引入了一种无监督算法ICM，可以在没有外部监督的情况下微调语言模型，自行生成高质量标签，性能超越仅靠人类监督的模型，尤其在超人能力模型任务中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于预训练语言模型的能力可能超越人类，很难获得高质量的人类监督，因此需要开发无需外部监督的新方法来指导这些模型进行下游任务。

Method: 提出了新的无监督算法——内部一致性最大化（ICM），用于微调预训练语言模型，依靠模型自身生成的标签进行训练，而非外部监督。

Result: 在GSM8k验证、TruthfulQA和Alpaca奖励建模任务中，ICM方法与使用黄金监督的培训性能相当，并优于人类监督。在语言模型能力显著超越人类的任务上，ICM方法显著更好。此外，ICM方法提升了无监督奖励模型的训练效果，并训练出了超过人类监督的Claude 3.5 Haiku助手。

Conclusion: 本文介绍了一种新的无监督算法，称为内部一致性最大化（ICM），用于微调预训练语言模型，能在无需外部监督的情况下生成优质标签。在某些任务上，ICM方法的性能与基于黄金监督培训相当，甚至在某些情况下优于基于人类监督的培训。对于具有超人能力的语言模型，ICM方法显著提高了其性能。此外，ICM方法还可以改善前沿语言模型的训练，提升了无监督奖励模型和基于Claude 3.5 Haiku的助手的表现。

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

### [8] [When Large Language Models are Reliable for Judging Empathic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10150)
*Aakriti Kumar,Nalin Poungpeth,Diyi Yang,Erina Farrell,Bruce Lambert,Matthew Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，大语言模型在同情对话的标注上接近专家水平并优于群众工作者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs对同情沟通微妙差异的判断能力，并与专家和群众工作者进行比较。

Method: 通过比较专家、群众工作者和LLMs在应用于200个真实世界对话的四个评估框架中的标注，来评估这些标注组之间的评分者间可靠性。

Result: LLMs在四个评估框架中都接近专家级别，并超过了群众工作者的可靠性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型（LLMs）在同情沟通的多框架评估中，已接近专家级别并超过群众工作者的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

*Yixin Ou,Yujie Luo,Jingsheng Zheng,Lanning Wei,Shuofei Qiao,Jintian Zhang,Da Zheng,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出的AutoMind框架解决了当前LLM代理的不足，在数据科学自动化中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架在真实世界中效率有限，不能有效解决复杂创新任务。

Method: 提出AutoMind框架，包含知识库、树搜索算法和自适应编码策略三大进步。

Result: 在两个自动化数据科学基准上，AutoMind表现优于当前最先进的方法，并通过多个分析验证其效果、效率和解决方案质量。

Conclusion: AutoMind表现出色于先进基线，展示了其在完全自动化数据科学方向上的效率与稳健性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

*Bidyarthi Paul,SM Musfiqur Rahman,Dipta Biswas,Md. Ziaul Hasan,Md. Zahid Hossain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了针对Bangla语言的情感分析，采用多种机器学习模型并结合特征选择技术，取得了较好的情感识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了推动对于资源有限语言的情感分析研究，本文探讨了通过多种技术手段来提高Bangla语言情感识别的效率。

Method: 本文采用了线性SVM、KNN和随机森林模型进行语言分析，使用TF-IDF向量化的n-gram数据。此外，还使用了PCA进行降维处理，以及BiLSTM模型和AdaBoost来加强决策树模型。为了提高模型解释性，使用了LIME对AdaBoost分类器的预测结果进行解释。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过机器学习模型和特征选择方法的结合，可以在Bangla语言情感识别中取得较好的效果。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合多种机器学习模型和特征选择方法，可以有效提升对具有文化特征的语言情感分析的准确性。

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

*Elizabeth Demers,Victor Xiaoqi Wang,Kean Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究使用word2vec算法创建了人力资本管理相关关键词词典，并共享了相关资源和代码供研究使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人力资本对企业价值创造越来越重要，但目前缺乏明确的衡量和披露规则。

Method: 我们使用了一种机器学习算法(word2vec)，训练一组经确认的人力资本披露数据，开发了一个包含五个子类别(多样性、公平与包容性；健康与安全；劳动关系与文化；薪酬与福利；人口统计与其他)的人力资本相关关键词的综合列表。

Result: 我们分享了我们的人力资本词典、企业人力资本披露以及开发词典所用的Python代码，并提供了详细的使用示例，包括微调BERT模型。

Conclusion: 本研究共享了我们的方法和数据集，期望推动相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

### [12] [Can LLMs Generate Good Stories? Insights and Challenges from a Narrative Planning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10161)
*Yi Wang,Max Kreminski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型生成故事的能力，特别是在叙述规划方面，并发现尽管对于生成因果合理的故事较为有效，但在处理角色意图和戏剧冲突方面仍面临困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为深化对LLMs在生成高质量故事能力的理解，通过解决叙事规划问题来评估LLMs的表现。

Method: 提出了一种基于文学例子的基准，用于评估LLMs在叙述规划中的表现，特别是在因果合理性、角色意图和戏剧冲突方面进行测试实验。

Result: 实验显示GPT-4级别的LLMs可以在小规模条件下生成因果合理的故事，但在处理角色意图和戏剧冲突上有困难，指出了应用于游戏环境的挑战。

Conclusion: 实验表明，GPT-4级别的LLMs在小规模情况下能生成因果合理的故事，但在角色意图和戏剧冲突的规划上仍具挑战性。需要通过强化学习训练的LLMs来完成复杂的推理。结果为不同方面的LLMs生成故事规模的质量提供了见解。

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

*Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Q2E方法提升了多语言文本到视频检索的精度，超越了现有技术，并表明整合音频信息可以改进检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进复杂现实事件视频的识别和检索，通过自动提取相关事件的潜在参数知识，并增强对文本查询的理解。

Method: 提出了一种名为Q2E的Query-to-Event分解方法，用于零样本多语言文本到视频的检索，采用了基于熵的多模态知识融合评分机制。

Result: Q2E在两个不同的数据集和多种检索指标上超过了若干最先进的基线方法，音频信息的整合显著改进了文本到视频的检索效果。

Conclusion: Q2E outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing understanding of human queries and integrating audio information.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

Conclusion: 尽管LRMs在复杂数学问题上表现出色，但在TTT-Bench中表现不佳，尤其是长程策略推理中。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

Motivation: 为了识别那些无意中误传信息的不可靠叙述者，我们提出使用计算方法来定义不同类型的不可靠叙述者。

Method: 借用叙事学的文学理论，根据各种文本现象定义不可靠叙述者的不同类型，并通过机器学习方法进行不可靠叙述者分类任务。

Result: 实验结果表明该任务具有很大挑战性，但使用大型语言模型可能有潜力识别不可靠叙述者，并提供一个人工标注的数据集和代码供未来研究使用。

Conclusion: 通过文学学习进行不可靠叙述者分类在真实世界文本数据中具有挑战性，但使用大型语言模型可能有潜力识别不可靠叙述者。

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

Motivation: 为了解决现有葡萄牙语数据集中社交媒体领域的主导性问题，并提供细粒度的仇恨言论分类工具，ToxSyn-PT 数据集应运而生，其目标是跨九个法律保护的少数群体实现仇恨言论分类。

Method: ToxSyn-PT 通过一个新的四阶段流程构建：1) 一个紧凑的手动整理的种子；2) 使用指导调优的大型语言模型进行的少量示范扩展；3) 基于复述的增强；4) 丰富化，并附加中性文本以避免过拟合到群体特定线索。

Result: 实验显示，在该语料库上的二元和多标签分类任务中，ToxSyn-PT 在五个公共葡萄牙语仇恨言论数据集上均表现出强劲的结果，展示了在传统基准数据集的领域差异下的良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT 数据集在五个公开的葡萄牙语仇恨言论数据集上取得了强劲的分类结果，展示了其在跨领域中的鲁棒泛化能力，并被公开发布以促进低资源环境下的合成数据与仇恨言论检测研究。

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们重新审视了一个关键问题：语言模型是否具备贝叶斯大脑？

Method: 我们提出了一种简单的方法来区分吉布斯采样中的随机和确定性决策模式，以帮助避免推断出误导性的语言模型先验。我们在各种大规模语言模型上进行了实验，以识别其在各种情况下的决策模式。

Result: 结果显示，语言模型可以展示接近于确定性的决策行为，这可能导致吉布斯采样收敛于“错误的先验”。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，在某些条件下，语言模型可以展示出接近于确定性的决策行为，比如在有非零采样温度的情况下进行最大似然估计。这对采样假设提出了挑战，并削弱了之前用于引出类人先验的方法。

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

Method: 本文采用了聚类和改进的Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)算法，将训练数据池进行聚类，并将簇间的数据选择问题视为一个受限的计算预算分配问题，作为多臂老虎机问题进行处理。

Result: 实验结果表明，ClusterUCB框架在各种基准测试中能够实现与原先方法相当的效果，但计算消耗大幅减少。

Conclusion: 本文提出的ClusterUCB框架可以在显著减少计算资源消耗的情况下，实现与原有梯度数据选择方法相当的效果。

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

TL;DR: Flick通过提炼高置信度伪标签，改进少标签分类，特别适用于低资源语言，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低资源语言的少标签分类中表现不佳，尤其是在噪声伪标签和领域适应方面存在问题。

Method: Flick方法通过从更广泛的初始集群中提炼出高置信度的伪标签来提高伪标签的质量。

Result: 在包含阿拉伯语、乌尔都语和塞茨瓦纳语等挑战性的低资源语言的数据集中，Flick显示出卓越的性能和适应性。

Conclusion: Flick在低资源语言环境下的表现优于现有方法，能够有效提升预训练语言模型的微调效果。

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在模拟教育环境中，使用者提供的建议如何影响LLM的表现，特别是在奉承风险较高的情境下。

Method: 使用了五种不同的LLM模型进行测试，这些模型来自OpenAI的GPT-4o和GPT-4.1类，横跨五种实验条件。

Result: LLM对问题的质量反应会根据查询框架发生显著变化。错误答案会降低15个百分点的正确性，而正确答案则能够提高同样幅度的准确性。较小的模型表现出更强的偏见，GPT-4.1-nano模型的正确性可以受影响达30%，而较大的GPT-4o模型仅有8%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在模拟教育环境中，用户建议如何影响大型语言模型（LLM）。发现模型会根据用户给出的答案选项发生偏见，这种行为可能加速知识渊博学生的学习，同时可能加剧不太了解的学生的误解。

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）主要在文本数据上训练，因此在处理语音到语音翻译时，文本到语音的模态适应成为一个难题。本文为解决这一训练困难，提出了新的训练方法。

Method: 本文提出了计划性交错语音-文本训练的方法。在训练中使用交错的语音-文本单元，其中对齐的文本标记在单词级别交错出现。随着训练的进行，逐渐减少文本的比例，以实现场景从文本到语音的逐步适应。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在语音到语音翻译任务中能够稳定提升翻译性能，特别是在训练数据有限的语言中。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种计划性交错语音-文本训练方法，能够显著提高语音到语音翻译的效果，尤其是对训练数据有限的语言效果更佳。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

Motivation: 获得可靠和准确的推理监督仍然是一个显著的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种利用程序执行的确定性生成高质量CoT监督数据集的方法，通过从代码执行中提取可验证的逐步推理轨迹，并将其转换为自然语言的CoT推理。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够为LLM在不同任务中提供可转移的推理能力，并且消融研究验证了该方法的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 我们的方法有效地为大型语言模型(LLM)提供了可转移的推理能力，并且减少了推理过程中的冗余和过度思考。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG方法在处理异构文档时存在局限性，包括表格和文本，尤其在保持表格结构和多步推理方面。这种局限性会导致信息丢失和推理能力下降。

Method: 提出TableRAG，一个结合文本理解和复杂表格数据操作的混合框架。TableRAG通过四个步骤迭代运行：上下文敏感的查询分解、文本检索、SQL编程和执行，以及合成中间答案生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，TableRAG在公共数据集和HeteQA基准上均超越现有基线，成为异构文档问答的新技术水平。

Conclusion: TableRAG在处理异构文档问题上提供了更强的性能和能力，并且大幅提升了多步推理能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于单独的验证器模型或多阶段的自我纠正训练过程，限制了可扩展性，亟需一种更有效的方法来提高模型自我验证能力。

Method: 引入了一种选择性修订机制，让模型只有在其生成性验证步骤检测到错误时才修正答案，并采用验证-然后-修订的工作流程。

Result: PAG不仅缓解了模型崩溃问题，还共同提高了推理和验证能力。实验表明，作为一种策略，它提高了直接生成和自我纠正的准确性；作为验证器, 它的自验证能力优于自洽性。

Conclusion: PAG框架通过在一个统一的多回合强化学习范式中在策略和验证者角色之间交替，从而提高了大型语言模型的自我纠正能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

Motivation: To assess and enhance the temporal reasoning abilities of multimodal large language models by introducing a comprehensive benchmark.

Method: Benchmark testing involving three main tests: event relation inference, sentence ordering, and image ordering.

Result: 38 MLLMs were evaluated, highlighting a significant performance gap between models and humans.

Conclusion: MLLMs currently struggle with TempVS benchmark tests, especially compared to human performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal
grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event
relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied
with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and
linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate
38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also
provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future
research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究新闻媒体在冲突期间使用的措辞选择，探究其对读者意见以及冲突本身的潜在影响，试图深入理解战争与和平新闻的指标。

Method: 本文结合框架语义学和大型语言模型的方法，采用计算的方式识别新闻报道中的沟通框架及其与语言框架的联系。

Result: 分析结果显示，当前新闻报道中更多关注战争而非和平内容。通过对美、英和中东新闻媒体的分析，显示出各国媒体在对冲突相关攻击者和受害者的报道上存在显著差异，揭示了媒体偏见。

Conclusion: 新闻媒体在冲突时期的措辞选择可能会对读者的看法产生重大影响，并可能加剧冲突。尽管已有研究对冲突措辞有一定的见解，但由于多为定性研究或只关注表面层次的泛框架，洞见有限。通过识别新闻报道中战争与和平新闻学的指标，揭示了当前报道更偏重于战争而非和平。并且各国媒体在报道攻击者和受害者时存在显著差异，这显示了媒体中的偏见。

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理改进方法常导致输出增加，增加计算延迟，而当前的方法未考虑问题复杂性，导致次优结果。因此，研究的动机是提升LLM推理的效率，针对简单问题促进简洁性，而对复杂问题则保持充分推理以确保准确性。

Method: 通过分割奖励函数和引入新的输出长度惩罚，管理模型的推理效率。

Result: 在三个数据集GSM8K、MATH500和AIME2024上进行的基准测试表明，本文提出的方法在较简单数据集上有效缩短了输出长度并保持或提高了准确性。在较复杂的AIME2024数据集上，方法提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在保持或提高准确性的同时，减少了在较简单数据集上的输出长度，在更复杂的数据集上提高了准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型仅预测最终标签，解释性有限，无法揭示模型推理过程。为解决此问题，将表格-文本对齐重新框定为解释任务，要求模型识别声明验证所需的关键单元格。

Method: 通过扩展SciTab基准，创建了一个带有人类注释的单元格级别依据的新数据集。注释者验证声明标签，并突出支持其决策所需的最小单元格集。对模糊案例进行处理的分类法随后被提出。

Result: 实验表明，纳入表对齐信息的模型在声明验证任务中具有更好的性能表现，而多数大型语言模型即使预测出正确的标签，仍失败于对齐人类依据。

Conclusion: 纳入表格对齐信息可以提高科学声明验证性能，但大多数大型语言模型虽然可以正确预测标签，却未能恢复与人类对齐的依据，表明其预测不是基于忠实推理。

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

*Aleksandra Sorokovikova,Pavel Chizhov,Iuliia Eremenko,Ivan P. Yamshchikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在不同情况下表现出偏见，特别是在涉及用户个性化内容时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型中的数据包含偏见，导致模型可能表现出有偏见的观点或基于用户个性提供不同结果。

Method: 通过多主题基准评估模型，重新设计任务以评估用户答案，并询问薪资谈判建议以测试偏见。

Result: 以不同方式测试偏见时（如修改任务或薪资建议），显示出更明显的偏见迹象。

Conclusion: 当询问模型用于薪资谈判建议时，明显的偏见出现，但在多主题基准上，预先提示的角色对结果影响微乎其微。

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

TL;DR: 研究评估了语言模型在多用户对话状态跟踪中的表现，发现其性能下降明显，并强调需进一步研究以优化其在多用户场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对话状态跟踪基准测试主要关注结构化的用户与代理对话，未能反映真实世界多用户交互的复杂性。

Method: 我们通过基于言语行为理论生成第二用户的utterances，将其系统化地引入现有DST数据集，以便在多用户环境中对语言模型进行控制评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，与单用户对话状态跟踪相比，多用户场景下语言模型的性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前的语言模型在多用户对话状态跟踪领域中存在显著性能下降，亟需进一步研究以提升其应对多用户场景的能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

TL;DR: 提出RRP框架，通过结合LLM的语义与结构信息优化知识图谱推理路径，显著提升LLM处理复杂问题的能力，并已在实验中展示领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有的增强型LLM侧重于补充事实知识，但在解决复杂问题时仍然表现不佳。因此，需要提炼事实之间的关系并将它们组织成逻辑一致的推理路径，这与事实知识本身同等重要。

Method: 提出了RRP框架，该框架结合了LLM的语义优势与通过关系嵌入和双向分布学习获得的结构信息。此外，还引入了重新思考模块，用于根据推理路径的重要性进行评估和优化。

Result: RRP在两个公共数据集上实现了领先的性能，并且能够以插拔方式轻松集成到各种LLM中，增强其推理能力。

Conclusion: RRP框架通过结合LLM的语义优势与关系嵌入及双向分布学习获得的结构信息，有效挖掘知识图谱，并利用重新思考模块评估和优化推理路径，从而显著增强LLM解决复杂问题的能力。实验结果表明，RRP在两个公共数据集上达到领先性能，且可以轻松集成到各种LLM中，提升其推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法主要依赖于音韵编辑的概率模型，这种数据驱动的方法有其局限性。研究者希望通过结合基于规则的启发式策略来克服这些限制。

Method: 该论文的方法是将数据驱动的推理与基于规则的启发式方法相结合，通过进化优化框架进行重构。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在字符级准确性和音韵合理性指标上相比基准模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种混合模型，在重构拉丁语词元任务中表现出优于基准模型的效果。

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

Motivation: 探索在语言模型中以高成本效益实现强推理能力的方法。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）在小参数（1.5亿）基础模型上进行参数高效更新的强化学习方法。

Result: Tina模型在多个开源推理数据集上表现出高效能和成本效益，以低成本（$9美元）实现 >20% 推理性能提升和43.33% AIME24的Pass@1准确率。

Conclusion: 通过LoRA进行高效RL推理的意外有效性，可以以极低成本实现强推理性能，同时保持基础模型的知识完整性。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

Method: 提出了一种名为SAE-Tuning的稀疏自动编码器调优方法，通过训练SAE捕获源模型的推理能力，并使用训练好的SAE指导标准的监督微调过程，以激发目标模型的推理能力。

Result: SAE-Tuning方法在训练成本方面显著降低，实现了比RL训练模型更高的推理性能保持。此外，它还展示了在轻度RL训练模型上的优越性能，并具有通用性和模块化。

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning是一种有效且经济的方法，可以提高语言模型的推理能力，同时兼具通用性和模块化特性。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

*Tatsuya Hiraoka,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with character-level tasks as they insufficiently encode character information in the embedding layer, relying on higher layers to reconstruct it. The study validates this through various analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level information during the spelling-out process, due to their difficulty in handling complex character-level tasks.

Method: The study uses three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge neurons, and inspection of attention weights to investigate how LLMs represent and utilize character-level information.

Result: The analysis reveals that LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge due to the insufficient encoding of this information in the embedding layer.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle to handle character-level tasks efficiently. The study shows that LLMs do not fully encode character-level information in the embedding layer, especially beyond the first character. LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer layers to reconstruct this information, leading to improved spelling behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

Motivation: 检测危及生命的语言对于保障困境中的个体、促进心理健康和福祉、防止可能的伤害和生命损失至关重要。

Method: 本文采用大型语言模型（LLMs），并将其与传统方法如词袋模型、词嵌入、主题建模和双向编码器表示（Transformers）进行比较。具体来说，对三个开源的LLMs（Gemma、Mistral和Llama-2）进行了微调，并使用其7B参数变体在不同的数据集上进行测试，这些数据集按照类别平衡、不平衡和极端不平衡场景进行构建。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs相比传统方法具有强劲的性能，尤其是Mistral和Llama-2在平衡和不平衡数据场景中表现最佳，而Gemma稍逊色。使用上采样技术处理不平衡数据时，虽然传统方法受益明显，但对LLMs的影响则不大。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）在检测危及生命的文本方面相较于传统方法表现出色，并且在实际应用中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型推理模型虽然在基准测试中表现出色，但其推理过程过于冗长，导致了过高的令牌使用和成本，限制了在延迟敏感或API受限环境中的部署。

Method: 引入通过提示进行的PRIME框架，通过追踪级别诊断和梯度启发的提示优化联合优化简洁性和准确性。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，PREMISE在不降低精度的情况下，实现了推理令牌减少高达87.5%，并将成本降低69%至82%。

Conclusion: PREMISE是一种有效的提示框架，可以在不降低推理质量的情况下显著减少大型推理模型的推理开销。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为ClaimSpect的框架，通过分层结构和语料库观点增强方法来分析复杂主张，验证了其在真实世界主张上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于科学和政治领域的许多主张具有复杂性，难以简单地标记为“真”或“假”，因此需要一种更全面的方法来分析这些主张。将复杂的主张拆分为较容易验证的子方面将有助于形成更结构化的回应和全面的视角。

Method: 提出ClaimSpect框架，结合检索增强生成方法，自动构建出一个层次结构，涉及在处理主张时通常考虑的各个方面，并通过特定语料库的观点丰富这些方面。

Result: ClaimSpect成功应用于各种真实世界的科学和政治主张，展示了其在解构复杂主张和表示语料库中的观点上的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 通过真实案例研究和人的评估验证，它相对于多种基础线具有更高的效果。

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

Motivation: 当前的自动分类法构建方法存在过度依赖特定语料库或大语言模型的普遍知识的不足，未能有效应对科学领域的动态变化和多维度特性。

Method: TaxoAdapt框架动态适配LLM生成的分类法至给定语料库的多个维度。该框架通过迭代分层分类，根据语料库的话题分布扩展分类法的宽度和深度。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

Result: 通过系统实验，发现通用分词器在语言适应能力上显著优于特定语言的分词器，增加了最高20.2%的胜率，并且对训练和分词中完全未见过的语言，胜率提高了5%。

Conclusion: 使用通用分词器能够显著提升大语言模型在多语言环境中的适应能力，并在不明显影响主要语言性能的情况下，实现对新语言的适应。

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangEdit effectively updates multilingual knowledge in LLMs without parameter interference, maintaining accuracy across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in LLMs while preserving consistent factual representations across languages.

Method: LangEdit, a null-space constrained framework that projects parameter updates onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.

Result: LangEdit outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods and enables efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge updates.

Conclusion: LangEdit can effectively mitigate parameter interference in multilingual knowledge updates, enhancing the performance of LLMs.

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

Result: 实验结果表明，与各种基线相比，ReCUT方法可以将推理长度减少约30-50%，同时保持或提高推理准确性。

Conclusion: ReCUT可以在提高推理准确性的同时显著减少推理长度。

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的dLLM采样策略存在静态行为，导致效率低下和灵活性不足，需寻找新方法提高性能。

Method: 提出了SlowFast Sampling，结合动态采样策略和dLLM-Cache进行加速，通过三条原则指导解码过程。

Result: SlowFast Sampling在LLaDA上实现了高达15.63倍的加速，并结合缓存后达到高达34.22倍的加速，同时准确性下降很小。

Conclusion: SlowFast Sampling策略实现了LLMs的更快和高效生成，特别是在与缓存结合时，通过设计合理的采样方式显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Motivation: 分析自监督语音模型中不同类型信息的表示方式和位置，特别是在多个语言环境下。

Method: 使用探测分类器和几何分析来检查模型如何表示音素、词汇音调和说话人信息。

Result: 训练和测试语言中，编码音素、音调和说话人的子空间大体上是正交的，层次探测准确度模式相似，对于匹配语言的音素和音调探测在较后层有较小优势，但不影响说话人。

Conclusion: wav2vec2模型的表示结构在训练时使用的语音材料中大体相同。

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Conclusion: MedRef proves to be more effective and reliable than existing systems for real-world healthcare applications, offering improved generation quality and medical entity accuracy.

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining

real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

Conclusion: 这项研究为理解大语言模型中基于上下文推理的表象提供了理论基础，提出了一种新方法来分析和缓解知识注入中不良行为的影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base

ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training
of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model,
and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's
capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal
understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral

Motivation: 早期的方法主要集中在个别神经元上，但因神经元通常编码多个概念，研究开始转向分析激活空间中的方向，需找到在无监督方式下捕获可解释特征的方向。

Method: 将MLP激活直接用半非负矩阵分解（SNMF）进行分解，使得学习到的特征是稀疏的线性组合，并映射到激活其的输入。

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在与人类偏好对齐方面的进展，它们在人与AI协作中的效用得到了显著提升。该领域忽视了“认知摩擦”在更新信念时所扮演的重要角色。当个体面临与现有信念相矛盾或模糊的信息时，认知摩擦便体现为一种固有的抗拒。

Method: 本文使用动态认知逻辑框架来分析认知摩擦，描述在情境协作任务中如何预测对话中的信念更新过程。

Result: 通过实际协作任务的分析，模型能够有效预测对话中的信念更新。同时，讨论了信念对齐模型如何能够变得更加复杂以适应真实对话场景中的复杂性。

Conclusion: 通过定义动态认知摩擦，并在动态认知逻辑框架中定位其作用，能够更好预测以及适应对话中信念更新的变化。认知摩擦作为一种信念修正的非平凡过程的重要性被强调。

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

*Mozhi Zhang,Howe Tissue,Lu Wang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain2Vec 是一种通过域向量表示数据混合的新方法，能够提高语言模型的预训练效果，减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用 Domain2Vec 改善语言模型预训练效果，并降低计算开销。引入元域作为捕捉数据集关键特征的概念。

Method: Domain2Vec 使用一个分类器将任何给定数据集分解为一个域向量，这个域向量对应于对元域词汇表的分布。

Result: Domain2Vec 在 Pile-CC 数据集上使用比原始的 The Pile 数据集更少的计算资源实现了相同的验证损失。在相同的计算预算下，通过数据混合提高了平均 2.83% 的下游性能。

Conclusion: Domain2Vec 在无需训练的情况下，通过优化数据混合，从而改善语言模型的预训练效果。实验表明，它能够有效提高下游任务的性能，同时显著降低计算开销。

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的有害内容检测资源主要集中在英语上，而中文数据集仍然稀缺且范围有限。

Method: 我们提出了一个全面的中文内容有害检测基准，涵盖六个典型类别，完全由真实世界数据构建。此外，通过注释过程创建了知识规则库，并提出了一种融合了人工注释知识规则和LLM隐性知识的知识增强基线。

Result: 较小的模型可以实现与最先进的大型语言模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated
harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy
violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review.
However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨推理模型在自我再评估方面的有效性，尤其是在识别和从不利思维中恢复的能力。

Method: 调查推理模型如何识别并从四种类型的不利思维中恢复，包括无信息的漫无边际的思维、与问题无关的思维、误导问题的思维和导致错误答案的思维。

Result: 推理模型能有效识别大多数不利思维，但难以从这些思维中恢复，导致性能显著下降。较大的模型在从短暂无关的思维中恢复时，比较小的模型更为困难。

Conclusion: 需要改进推理模型的自我再评估能力，以开发更好的推理和更安全的系统。

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

TL;DR: 文章提出了AI系统中可证明正确性与数据映射能力之间的权衡，并分析其哲学及实践影响，强调验证此猜想对可信AI未来的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文章旨在明确并严格验证AI系统中可证明的正确性与广泛数据映射能力之间的基本权衡，以重新定义AI的工程目标和哲学期望。

Method: 文章在信息理论的形式中表述了这一猜想，并将其置于更广泛的认识论、形式验证和技术哲学的辩论中加以背景化分析。

Result: 通过将这一先前隐含的权衡显式化并开放验证，猜想显著重新构定了AI的工程野心和哲学期望，并分析了该猜想的影响和后果。

Conclusion: 结论强调了最终证明或反驳这一不等式对于值得信赖的AI未来的重要性。

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: 提出“上下文切换”AI模型，旨在不需重新训练即可适应多变的医疗环境，提高准确性及扩大医疗服务可及性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学基础模型在适应新的人群、专业或环境时需要微调、仔细提示或从知识库中检索，这通常不切实际，并限制了它们解释不熟悉输入和适应未在训练中表示的临床情况的能力。

Method: 本文探讨了一种“上下文切换”AI模型的愿景，该模型能够在不重新训练的情况下动态调整推理，以适应新的专业、人口、工作流程和临床角色。

Result: 传统模型在动态调整以适应不断演变的医疗环境方面存在困难，容易出现忽略关键患者信息的错误。提出的新模型能够解决这一问题，提高医疗AI的适应性和准确性。

Conclusion: 在未来的设想中，AI模型无需重新训练即可动态适应不同的医学环境和角色，能够在各种专业和地区诊断、管理和治疗多种疾病，从而扩大医疗服务的可及性。

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

Motivation: 在阿尔茨海默病研究中，理解因果关系和相关性之间的区别对于诊断、治疗和识别真正的疾病驱动因素至关重要。

Method: 该实验结合了关联分析、机器学习分类和模型解释技术，以XGBoost算法为核心，利用SHAP值分析特征贡献。

Result: 我们识别了影响阿尔茨海默病分类的关键特征，并展示了强相关性并不一定意味着因果关系。

Conclusion: 通过整合特征重要性和解释性技术与传统统计分析，该研究为未来因果推断研究奠定了基础，以揭示真正的病理机制。

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

Conclusion: 在单队配置中训练和评估代理时，方法能够击败专业的VGC选手，但随着团队规模的扩大，最佳算法也难以扩展。因此，不同团队策略之间的策略泛化仍然是一个开放挑战。

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

Result: 设计了一种基于LLM的兵棋推演代理，综合评估其策略推理能力。

Conclusion: 使用WGSR-Bench，我们可以评估当前最先进LLMs在博弈论战略推理中的优缺点，并推动大型模型驱动的战略智能研究。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

TL;DR: 研究表明，随着AI能力的提升，验证其安全性所需的复杂性也在增加，形成一个计算不可行的"难以逾越的空白"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力的提升，社会对其安全性的需求也在增加，但这与安全性验证的复杂性形成了不可避免的矛盾，因此需要寻找理论上的解决方案。

Method: 通过建立和证明四个核心定理来证明AI安全性验证的复杂性，包括验证复杂性与系统表达能力之间的指数关系等。

Result: 证明了在超出某个临界阈值的AI系统中，安全性验证需要指数时间，并且是coNP完全问题。安全策略只占策略空间的一个极小比例，没有有限的对齐技术集可以提供普适性的覆盖，且鲁棒安全属性在神经网络中形成测度为零的集合。

Conclusion: 本研究通过计算复杂性理论的分析，指出没有一种普适的对齐技术能够完全覆盖AI的安全性需求，且当前的安全要求大多处于计算不可行的区域。

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

Conclusion: Optimus-3显著超越了通用的多模态大型语言模型和现有的最先进代理在Minecraft环境中的不同任务中表现。

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a
knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and
high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for
visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的GUI代理Mirage-1，通过层次多模态技能和技能增强蒙特卡罗树搜索，显著提升了长时间任务的执行效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大型语言模型作为GUI代理在长时间任务中表现不足，主要原因是知识不足和离线与在线域之间的差距。

Method: 提出了层次多模态技能模块（HMS）和技能增强蒙特卡罗树搜索（SA-MCTS）算法，以增强知识结构和缩小离线与在线域之间的差距。

Result: 实验结果显示，Mirage-1在多个基准测试中优于之前的代理，提升幅度为32%、19%、15%和79%。

Conclusion: 层次多模态技能和技能增强蒙特卡罗树搜索能够有效提升GUI代理在长时间任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,
MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively. Project page:

Conclusion: 通过将决策制定和自适应工具使用嵌入检索过程，有望提升RAG系统在复杂场景中的表现。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured
tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning,
dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

Abstract: As models become increasingly sophisticated, conventional algorithm
benchmarks are increasingly saturated, underscoring the need for more
challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning.
This paper introduces OIBench, a high-quality, private, and challenging
olympiad-level informatics dataset comprising 250 carefully curated original

comprehensive assessment across various programming paradigms and complexities,
and we demonstrate its contamination-resistant properties via experiments. We
propose Time/Space Completion Curves for finer-grained efficiency analysis and
enable direct human-model comparisons through high-level participant
evaluations. Our experiments reveal that while open-source models lag behind
closed-source counterparts, current SOTA models already outperform most human
participants in both correctness and efficiency, while still being suboptimal
compared to the canonical solutions. By releasing OIBench as a fully
open-source resource (https://huggingface.co/datasets/AGI-Eval/OIBench), we
hope this benchmark will contribute to advancing code reasoning capabilities
for future LLMs.

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning

Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this

abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

TL;DR: 引入LogiPlan基准评估大语言模型在复杂关系结构上的推理能力，发现较新模型在简单任务中表现好，但在复杂任务中尚存不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逻辑关系推理对需要依赖大语言模型生成和查询结构化关系图的应用至关重要，如网络基础设施、知识库或业务流程架构。因此，此项研究旨在评估大语言模型在复杂关系结构上的逻辑规划和推理能力。

Method: 该研究引入了一个名为LogiPlan的新基准，通过控制对象、关系数量和关系链的最小深度，对任务复杂度进行动态变化，从而细致评估模型在不同难度层级下的性能。LogiPlan包含三个互补任务：计划生成、一致性检测和比较问题。此外，还通过提示模型验证和改善其初始解决方案来评估模型的自我纠错能力。

Conclusion: 尽管最新的增强推理模型在较简单的实例中表现出色，但在更复杂的配置下，特别是需要更深入的逻辑规划时，这些模型表现不佳。

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

Result: 通过实验，证明LLMs在理解和生成Primender序列中表现出符号推理的潜在能力，但也显示出需要改进的方面。模型需要提高在推断规则、验证假设和生成下一个序列项的能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的整数序列Primender序列，作为评估大语言模型（LLMs）符号推理能力的基准。通过设计结构化提示和评估框架，对多个最先进的LLMs进行测试。研究发现这些模型在推理规则、验证假设、生成序列等方面的性能有待提升。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

Conclusion: 这项研究提出了一种新的诊断方法，能够在仅需基本的子系统关系理解和正常运行数据的情况下运作，展示了该方法在处理大型复杂的网络-物理系统中的实用潜力。

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

Conclusion: 最近专为数学或逻辑推理设计的LLMs在TeleMath上的表现最佳，而通用型模型即使参数众多，也常难以应对这些挑战。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

Motivation: AML的标准化数据交换缺乏自动验证机制，该研究旨在引入一种能够形式化和验证AML建模约束的方法，以提高AML模型的验证效率。

Method: 该论文引入了一条将AML模型映射到OWL本体的流程，利用RML和SPARQL进行映射以及大型语言模型将文本规则转换为SHACL约束，然后针对生成的AML本体进行验证，最后自然语言自动解读SHACL验证结果的方法。

Result: 该方法通过一个AML推荐的示例进行了演示，结果表明，即使是复杂的建模规则也能在不失效率的前提下通过半自动化的方式进行验证，用户无需理解复杂的形式化方法或本体技术。

Conclusion: 复杂的建模规则可以通过半自动化的方式进行验证，无需用户理解形式化方法或本体技术。

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds
input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We
demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a
dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its
performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts
instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex
solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently
explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization
problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from
Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging
environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution
refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both
ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个通过将链式思维(COT)推理与模型上下文协议(MCP)相结合的框架，优化了大语言模型(LLM)在模拟时空行为方面的能力，成功改善了生成数据与真实数据的相似性和计算效率。

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning
research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from
high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While
large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face
challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,
lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.
This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating
spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The
methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage
cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP
tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental
perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.
Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's
effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high
similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores
of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments
show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to
0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work
contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling,
advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical
approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a
foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and
participatory urban design applications.

Abstract: Classical AI Planning techniques generate sequences of actions for complex
tasks. However, they lack the ability to understand planning tasks when
provided using natural language. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
introduced novel capabilities in human-computer interaction. In the context of
planning tasks, LLMs have shown to be particularly good in interpreting human
intents among other uses. This paper introduces GenPlanX that integrates LLMs
for natural language-based description of planning tasks, with a classical AI

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

TL;DR: RLVR 能够提高某些模型的数学推理能力，即使使用虚假奖励，但效果因模型而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过强化学习与可验证奖励(RLVR)激发和提高模型的数学推理能力，即使在奖励信号不可靠或不存在的情况下。

Method: 通过强化学习与可验证奖励(Spurious rewards)，观察数学推理能力的训练过程及其效果。

Result: 在 Qwen2.5-Math-7B 模型上，无论是随机奖励还是错误标签等虚假奖励，表现的提升几近达到了利用真实奖励所能获得的提升。尤其在代码推理方面，RLVR 显著提高了 Qwen2.5-Math 模型的代码推理能力表现。

Conclusion: RLVR 在某些模型中，即使出现虚假奖励，也能激发强大的数学推理能力。然而，这种机制在不同模型中表现不一，特别是对 Llama3 或 OLMo2 等模型效果有限。

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成多场景和多角色的连贯叙事视频仍然困难，目前的方法通常将预生成的关键帧转换为固定长度的片段，导致叙事和节奏问题。

Method: 引入AniMaker框架，使用多代理系统进行多候选片段生成和选择，包括导演代理、摄影代理、审查代理和后期制作代理。

Result: 实验表明，AniMaker在提高生成质量的同时显著提高了多候选生成的效率，将AI生成叙事动画推向生产标准。

Conclusion: AniMaker框架通过使用MCTS-Gen和AniEval技术，实现了从文本输入到全球一致且故事连贯的动画生成，并在质量和效率上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent
storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains
challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into
fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.
Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that
even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output
animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient
multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus
creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text
input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the
Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip
generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent
for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical
components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to
generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in
Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot
animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level
consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering
each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments
demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular
metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while
significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing
AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了高阶无关联学习动力学对有限游戏中混合策略纳什均衡的可学习性，发现学习动力学有局部适用性和普适性限制，并提出ABR性质以应对学习限制，同时在bandit环境下进行相关分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过施加自然限制，探讨允许学习动力学，并引入ABR性质，以应对混合策略纳什均衡的学习问题。研究希望通过高阶无关联学习与去中心化控制反馈稳定性之间的联系，揭示学习动力学的实现可能性与限制。

Method: 研究使用高阶复制器动力学以及高阶无关联异质动力学类来分析混合策略纳什均衡的可学习性。引入了带有渐近最佳响应（ABR）性质的动力学，并提供条件说明纳什均衡与ABR性质的兼容性。同时在bandit环境下，通过bandit版的高阶复制器动力学处理混合策略纳什均衡的学习性问题。

Result: 证明了在某些条件下，存在与某个完全混合策略隔离的纳什均衡的有限游戏，可以通过特定高阶无关联学习动力学达到。此外，发现动力学的普适性有限，即一种动力学适用于某个游戏的同时不会适用于另一个游戏。此外，在bandit环境下，也研究了混合策略纳什均衡的可学习性。

Conclusion: 通过高阶无关联学习动力学和反馈稳定性之间的关联，研究表明在任何有限游戏中，若存在一个与完全混合策略纳什均衡隔离的点，则存在高阶无关联学习动力学可以（局部）引导到该均衡。但学习动力学缺乏普适性，即学会某一游戏的完全混合策略纳什均衡的动力学不能学会另一个游戏的同一均衡。

Abstract: We study learnability of mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium (NE) in general
finite games using higher-order replicator dynamics as well as classes of
higher-order uncoupled heterogeneous dynamics. In higher-order uncoupled
learning dynamics, players have no access to utilities of opponents (uncoupled)
but are allowed to use auxiliary states to further process information
(higher-order). We establish a link between uncoupled learning and feedback
stabilization with decentralized control. Using this association, we show that
for any finite game with an isolated completely mixed-strategy NE, there exist
higher-order uncoupled learning dynamics that lead (locally) to that NE. We
further establish the lack of universality of learning dynamics by linking
learning to the control theoretic concept of simultaneous stabilization. We
construct two games such that any higher-order dynamics that learn the
completely mixed-strategy NE of one of these games can never learn the
completely mixed-strategy NE of the other. Next, motivated by imposing natural
restrictions on allowable learning dynamics, we introduce the Asymptotic Best
Response (ABR) property. Dynamics with the ABR property asymptotically learn a
best response in environments that are asymptotically stationary. We show that
the ABR property relates to an internal stability condition on higher-order
learning dynamics. We provide conditions under which NE are compatible with the
ABR property. Finally, we address learnability of mixed-strategy NE in the
bandit setting using a bandit version of higher-order replicator dynamics.

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: NOCL框架通过节点描述和节点概念技术将图任务转化为语言任务，解决了LLMs在图应用中的挑战，实现了较好的零样本推广。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的消息传递神经网络(MPNNs)在依赖监督学习的情况下，在标签稀少的场景中很难推广。自监督方法仍需标签微调，零样本场景效果有限。大型语言模型(LLMs)在图应用中面临挑战，包括保存推理能力、管理来自丰富节点属性的长令牌以及仅限于文本属性图(TAGs)和单级别任务。

Method: 提出了一种新的Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM (NOCL)框架，包括两项核心技术：节点描述技术，将异构节点属性转换为结构化自然语言；节点概念技术，利用预训练语言模型将节点描述编码为紧凑的语义嵌入。NOCL还采用图表示描述符，将不同层次的图任务统一为语言查询格式。

Result: NOCL在监督场景下表现与传统MPNNs及混合LLM-MPNN方法相当，在零样本设置中展现出优越的推广能力。

Conclusion: NOCL通过将图任务转化为语言任务，有效克服了LLMs在图应用中的挑战，提供了一种新的图基础模型方向。

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 传统的逆设计方法需要耗时的数值模拟和优化过程。

Method: 使用深度学习和串联神经网络解决薄膜光学逆设计问题。

Result: LSTM-LSTM模型精度最高但训练时间最长，CNN-LSTM模型在精度和速度上表现最佳。

Conclusion: CNN-LSTM的TNN是逆设计SiO2/TiO2薄膜的最优解决方案。

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

Motivation: 现有的直接偏好优化方法忽略了偏好对质量和学习效用的差异，导致数据利用率和性能不佳。

Method: 通过双视角优化框架，采用自适应加权样本，根据数据质量和模型学习动态调整训练权重。

Result: 在文本理解任务中，微调后的Gemma-2-9b-it使用Omni-DPO在Arena-Hard基准上击败领先的LLM Claude 3 Opus 6.7分。在数学推理任务中，Omni-DPO一致优于所有基准方法。

Conclusion: Omni-DPO能够更有效地利用训练数据，并在文本理解和数学推理任务中表现优异，显著超越现有基线方法。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在解决复杂现实任务方面的能力日益增强，如何准确量化这些模型的不确定性成为一个重要的开放性问题，这限制了其在高风险领域的应用。

Method: 通过将LLM系统视为贝叶斯模型的一部分，将提示词视为统计模型中的文本参数，并采用小型训练数据集对这些提示词进行贝叶斯推断。引入了一种新颖的Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)算法，称为Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP)，该算法结合了提示词优化技术与标准的MCMC方法。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在多个LLM基准和不确定性量化任务上提高了预测准确性和不确定性量化能力。

Conclusion: 本文为将丰富的贝叶斯理论方法应用于LLM时代的实践提供了可行的路径，为实现更可靠和校准的LLM系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的HVAE方法在潜在维度的分配上较为随意，容易导致表示无效或后验坍塌，影响OOD检测的性能。因此，需要一种系统的方法来优化潜在维度的分配。

Method: 提出了一个基于信息理论的框架，优化HVAE的潜在维度分配，以增强表示能力。通过理论证明固定潜在预算下最佳分配比率的存在性，并通过实验证明其在OOD检测中的有效性。

Result: 调优最佳分配比率可以在不同的数据集和架构上显著改进OOD检测性能，并优于现有的HVAE基线配置。

Conclusion: 该研究通过优化潜在维度分配，显著提升了层次变分自编码器（HVAE）在OOD检测任务中的表现。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

Motivation: 在bandit问题中，既有方法如UCB和Thompson Sampling虽然在理论上表现良好，但在实践中可能存在优化空间。因此，我们提出了新的算法框架，期望通过随机化和探索分布的引入，改善实际表现及计算效率。

Method: 我们提出了一类被称为GP-Generic的计算有效的核化bandit算法。这些算法基于新的探索分布概念，包括了UCB为基础的方法，并允许多种随机化算法的实现。通过精心选择探索分布，我们的通用算法能够实现多种具体算法，实现O(\tilde{\gamma_T}\sqrt{T})的遗憾界限。

Conclusion: 我们的研究提出了一类通用的算法，该算法在理论上实现了与Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)和Thompson Sampling等已有算法相同的遗憾界限，并且展示了在实践中，随机化可以带来更好的效果。这为使用核化方法解决bandit问题提供了一种新的框架和方法。

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种两阶段深层自编码器用于MNIST数据的无监督聚类，显著提升了聚类性能并展示了良好的可视化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对MNIST手写数字进行无监督学习聚类需提高识别的准确性和稳定性，找到数据重构与聚类分离纯度之间的最佳结合。

Method: 研究采用两阶段深度自编码器架构：第一阶段通过最小化重建误差获取图像的简化表现形式；第二阶段结合重建误差与KMeans聚类损失，通过一个联合距离目标进行学习。从而提高潜在空间的聚类性能。实现过程中使用了批量标准化、dropout和权重衰减。

Result: 该方法在与内在指标（包括轮廓分数和Davies-Bouldin指数）以及外部指标（如NMI和ARI）的对比测试中表现优异。使用t-SNE可视化展示模型学习到的明显数字簇。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种先进的无监督聚类系统，通过应用两阶段深层自编码器架构，实现对MNIST手写数字的聚类任务，并在多项测试中表现出优越的聚类性能。

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction
errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans
clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based
objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization
combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable
results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during
extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score
and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when
processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present
learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches
an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster
separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and
scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps
deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image
clustering applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的联邦多任务学习方法，通过共享特征锚点和分类头，以及基于社区检测的图正则化来提高个性化和协作效率。实验证明该方法在性能和效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为每个客户启用个性化学习，同时避免传输整个模型到参数服务器，以提高通信效率。

Method: 我们提出了一种通信高效的方案，其中引入了特征锚点这种紧凑的向量表示，摘要了从客户本地类中学习的特征，并与服务器共享。此外，客户还共享分类头并执行基于图的正则化，以实现客户间的协作。我们通过将客户间的协作建模为动态图，并持续更新和优化该图，利用基于社区检测的方法将该图划分为同质社区，以限制协作仅限于构成社区的高度相似客户，以确保积极的交互并保持个性化。

Result: 我们的方法在两个异构数据集上的性能显著优于最先进的基线方法，并且展示了出色的计算和通信效率。

Conclusion: 我们的模型在计算和通信效率上表现出显著优势，并且在促进客户之间的公平性方面表现优异。

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

TL;DR: 为了降低计算复杂度，同时模拟复杂自然现象，提出了非负扩散(NnD)模型，能够通过学习生成和推理非负物理对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂自然现象，如云的形成，虽然可以通过模拟来计算，但计算代价高昂并限制了其可扩展性。

Method: 通过学习基于得分的扩散模型，并使用退火Langevin动力学来保证在场景生成和分析过程中的非负性。

Result: 成功生成了与云物理学趋势一致的3D体积云，这些云在专家的感知中也未被视为非物理。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的生成模型——非负扩散(NnD)，可以大幅降低计算复杂度，同时保证物理意义上的非负性。

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图形AL方法通常在静态图数据集上进行评估，主要关注预测准确性，忽视了用户驱动的考虑，如采样多样性、查询公平性以及对动态环境的适应性。

Method: 引入了一个名为GRAIL的新型基准测试框架，用于在动态的真实世界环境中评估图形AL策略。GRAIL引入了新的指标，以评估在不同条件下AL方法的持续有效性、多样性和用户负担。

Result: 在包含动态、真实生活人类传感器数据的数据集上的广泛实验揭示了预测性能和用户负担之间的权衡，突显出现有AL策略的局限性。

Conclusion: GRAIL展示了在动态环境中平衡节点重要性、查询多样性和网络拓扑的重要性，并为图形AL解决方案提供了一种评估机制。

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: 在无感知情境下，A-CAPELLA算法能够实现信息分布式多玩家多臂老虎机问题的学习，保证对未知容量的学习效率，并达到对数遗憾。

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了离线域随机化（ODR），提出形公式估计和新的E-DROPO算法，证明其在缩小sim-to-real误差方面的理论优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决强化学习代理从模拟到现实世界部署时的困难，提出利用离线数据进行离线域随机化（ODR），以缩小sim-to-real差距。

Method: 首先将ODR形式化为对参数模拟器家族的最大似然估计，并在温和的规则性和可识别性条件下证明这种估计的一致性，推导出ODR的sim-to-real误差比标准DR更小的间隙界限，并引入E-DROPO算法。

Result: ODR的sim-to-real误差在有限模拟器情况下比标准DR最多可缩小到O(M)因子，同时在连续设置中获得类似的收益。

Conclusion: 引入了一种新的E-DROPO算法，通过增加熵奖励防止方差崩溃，从而在实践中实现更广泛的随机化和更强的零次传输能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的增强型GCBC方法，通过时间一致性促进组合性泛化，无需对比样本或TD学习，表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的目标条件行为克隆方法在处理新颖状态目标对的零次泛化时存在局限性，这主要归因于行为克隆学习过程中状态表示缺乏时间一致性。为了减小新颖目标状态对的分布差异，需在表示空间中促进这种时间一致性。

Method: 提出了一种新的表征学习目标，称为BYOL-γ增强的GCBC,无需对比样本或TD学习。

Result: 在不使用对比样本或TD学习的情况下，BYOL-γ增强的GCBC方法在多个需要组合性泛化的复杂任务中以竞争性的表现证明了其实力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的表示学习目标，通过增强的GCBC方法，实现了有限MDP情况下的后继表示理论近似，无需对比样本或TD学习。在实际任务中表现出竞争力，可处理需要组合性泛化的任务。

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Motivation: 对训练玩推箱子游戏的卷积递归神经网络进行逆向工程，理解其使用模型无关的强化学习方式解决问题的机制。

Method: 使用部分逆向工程的方法分析神经网络，揭示其使用类似经典双向搜索的方法来解决问题。

Result: 分析显示神经网络在测试时使用更多计算资源能够解决更多关卡，其解决机制可类比为一个过渡模型。

Conclusion: 通过理解神经网络的运作机制，可以看到它使用的算法在很多方面类似于经典搜索算法，同时也有其独特之处。

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对传统生存分析方法在处理复杂数据结构和高度删失数据时面临的挑战。

Method: 结合不精确概率理论与注意力机制，引入三种新生存模型：iSurvM、iSurvQ和iSurvJ。使用区间值概率分布表示删失观察，采用基于核的Nadaraya-Watson回归与可训练的注意力权重来计算时间间隔上的不精确概率分布。

Result: 实验表明，提出的模型特别是iSurvJ在准确性和计算复杂度方面优于Beran估计器。

Conclusion: 提出的模型能够在不依赖参数假设的情况下处理删失数据，提供更优的性能。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

Result: 经过13个数据集和13个评分函数的实证评估，我们的双曲嵌入在相同数据和相同骨干下的表现优于现有的分布外方法，同时也优于其他双曲方法，超越了最新对比方法，并且自然地支持分层分布外泛化。

Conclusion: 一个良好的分层双曲空间嵌入对于区分分布内和分布外样本是优选的。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的对比学习方法如SimCLR和SupCon尽管性能优异，但缺乏不确定性量化的机制。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的无解码器框架，即变分对比学习（VCL），通过将InfoNCE损失解释为代理重建项并添加KL散度正则化器来最大化证据下界（ELBO）。具体方法包括使用投影正态分布建模近似后验，并通过$q_\theta(z|x)$采样概率嵌入，最终将其应用于VSimCLR和VSupCon。

Result: 实验证明，VCL方法缓解了维度崩溃，提高了与类别标签的互信息，在分类准确性上匹配或超越了确定性基线，并且提供了后验模型下有意义的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: VCL为对比学习提供了一个概率基础，并在不降低分类准确性的同时提供了有意义的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

Motivation: 现有的深度离策略演员评论算法在样本效率上存在不足，尤其是在奖励稀疏的环境中，因此需要改进样本效率。

Method: 提出了一种名为Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) 的方法，通过使用悲观和乐观策略的Wasserstein重心作为探索策略，并在学习过程中调整探索的程度，来提高样本效率。

Result: WBSAC算法在MuJoCo连续控制任务中的样本效率优于现有的先进算法。

Conclusion: WBSAC算法比现有的离策略演员评论算法在MuJoCo连续控制任务上更具样本效率。

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: 提出了一种改进的动态规划方案以优化采样时间表，从而提高图像生成的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DynaSubVAE通过动态子群机制，实现优于传统方法的OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型无法有效处理偏离全局模式的异质子群的问题，尤其是在OOD检测中通常忽视这些样本的问题。

Method: DynaSubVAE使用变分自编码器框架，结合非参数聚类机制，对嵌入相似性进行建模和子群发现。其动态更新潜在结构以捕捉数据中的新趋势。

Result: DynaSubVAE在近OOD和远OOD检测方面具有竞争力，尤其是在训练时缺失整个类别的class-OOD检测场景中表现出色。动态子群机制在OOD准确率和后悔精度方面优于单独的GMM和KMeans++聚类方法。

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE在处理观测数据中的不均匀子群方面表现出色，能够动态适应新兴模式并提高OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

Motivation: 尽管ECG和PCG能够提供关于心脏功能的全面多模态视角，但其信号信息的独立性和重叠性，以及它们相互重建和生物标志物提取的潜力，特别是在不同生理条件和个体之间，尚未完全了解。

Method: 本文使用线性和非线性机器学习模型，包括非因果LSTM网络，来重建ECG和PCG信号，并分析因果性、生理状态和个体差异的影响。

Result: 结果显示，非线性模型特别是非因果LSTM提供了更出色的重建性能，运动和跨个体情景下挑战显著，但基于包络的建模利用瞬时幅度特征显著提高了跨个体泛化能力。此外，还能在跨个体情况下从PCG中估算ECG的临床相关生物标志物。

Conclusion: 研究表明，非线性模型尤其是非因果LSTM在ECG和PCG的重建中表现优异，尤其是从PCG重建ECG较为易于实现。研究还表明，即便在跨个体的情况下，也能够从PCG中估算出临床相关的ECG生物标志物。

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Motivation: 由于现代应用对模拟拓扑设计的定制化需求较多，手动工程工作繁重，因此需要自动化模拟拓扑设计。

Result: 实验表明，在0.01的紧密容差下，LaMAGIC2的成功率提高了34%，均方误差降低了10倍。此外，对于具有更多顶点的电路，LaMAGIC2的可转移性提高了58.5%。

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2是一个强大的模拟拓扑生成框架，能够在紧密容差下显著提高成功率并降低均方误差，同时在顶点更多的电路中表现出较好的可转移性。

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

Motivation: 现有的联邦学习聚类方法无法处理复杂的分布式结构，尤其是在水平和垂直分割共存的情况下。因此，本研究提出了一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: DC-Clustering方法中，每个机构仅分享中间表示而非原始数据，确保隐私保护的同时实现协作聚类。该方法允许在k-means和谱聚类之间灵活选择，并通过与中央服务器的一轮通信实现最终结果。

Result: 大量实验表明，DC-Clustering实现了与集中式聚类（所有数据汇总）相当的聚类性能。

Conclusion: DC-Clustering填补了当前联邦学习研究中的一个重要空白，通过支持复杂数据分区场景下的无原始数据共享聚类，促进了分布式异构数据的有效知识发现。

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

Result: 通过使用合成噪声的真实数据集和真实的众包数据集，我们的方法证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在处理中噪声标注数据时证明了其有效性，特别是在标注数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

Motivation: 研究者发现半定规划松弛在应用于带有ReLU激活的深度神经网络验证时存在一个关键限制：内点消失，这导致严格可行性丧失，从而影响数值稳定性和最优性。

Method: 作者设计了五种解决方案，以增强验证问题的可行性条件，进行理论和实证分析。

Result: 所提出的方法成功解决了88%无法通过现有方法解决的问题，占总问题的41%。并且发现以往用于每个ReLU单元上下界的约束实际上对问题的可行性有害。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了关于基于SDP的DNN验证基础挑战的关键洞察，并为改进其在深层神经网络中的适用性提供了实用的解决方案，有助于开发更可靠和安全的DNN系统。

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将多模态与结构化的图信息（即多模态图，MMGs）相结合是社交网络、医疗保健和推荐系统等现实应用必不可少的。现有的多模态图学习方法分为三种范式：编码器、对齐器和预测器，而这些方法缺乏一个统一的基准来公平评估它们的表现。

Method: 本文采用了一个名为Graph-MLLM的综合基准，系统评估了多模态图学习中的三种范式：编码器、对齐器和预测器，跨六个不同领域的数据集进行实验。

Result: 研究发现结合使用视觉和文本属性对节点的图学习有益，特别是在将视觉属性转换为文本描述以后，效果更佳。此外，微调MLLMs在特定多模态图上的表现达到了大多数场景中最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用视觉和文本属性联合进行图学习，即使在使用预训练的文本到图像对齐模型（如CLIP）作为编码器时，也可以提升性能。此外，将视觉属性转换为文本描述后，比直接使用视觉输入更能提高性能。微调MLLMs在特定的多模态图上可以在多数情况下达到最先进的结果，甚至在没有显式图结构信息的情况下也能实现。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

Conclusion: 在多臂老虎机问题研究中，本文引入了Col-UCB算法，以在组间共享的情境下动态地协调探索。

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using meta-learning to enhance sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia, improving performance, particularly in limited data scenarios, and introduces a new dataset for future exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia by developing a model that can quickly adapt to the unique behaviours of different sockpuppet groups, especially when text data is scarce.

Method: The paper employs meta-learning, a machine learning technique that focuses on rapid adaptation to new tasks, to enhance sockpuppet detection on platforms like Wikipedia.

Result: The study finds that using meta-learning improves the precision of sockpuppet detection significantly compared to traditional pre-trained models. Additionally, a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations is provided to support further research.

Conclusion: Meta-learning significantly outperforms pre-trained models in detecting sockpuppets, especially in data-scarce environments, highlighting an effective approach to combating disinformation.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to

*Paul Janson,Benjamin Therien,Quentin Anthony,Xiaolong Huang,Abhinav Moudgil,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PyLO通过PyTorch库，将训练优化器带入广泛应用，提升大规模任务处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前环境下，一些先进的训练优化器缺乏用户友好的应用接口，且局限于某些框架之内，限制了其在更大范围内的应用。

Method: 推出基于PyTorch的PyLO库，支持现有优化工具的整合，并加速小fc_lopt架构的应用。

Result: 实现从39.36提升至205.59样本/秒的大规模预训练任务处理速度的显著提升。

Conclusion: PyLO为机器学习社区提供了一种易于使用的PyTorch库，使得训练过的优化器更易于被广泛应用。

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

### [128] [Air in Your Neighborhood: Fine-Grained AQI Forecasting Using Mobile Sensor Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10332)
*Aaryam Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper uses Spatio-temporal GNNs to significantly improve the accuracy of AQI predictions in specific small areas, reducing error by 79% compared to previous models, and discovers new AQI patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution data from government sources is often generalized and does not reflect local conditions accurately due to sparse sensors. There's a need for more precise AQI predictions in specific areas.

Method: The paper uses Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict AQI in localized 1 km^2 neighborhoods.

Result: The method achieved a 79% reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE), improving upon existing models significantly, including the ability to predict AQI even in previously unobserved areas.

Conclusion: Spatio-temporal GNNs can effectively predict AQI in small areas, improving prediction accuracy significantly and revealing new insights like short-term patterns in AQI data.

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

*Wanqiao Xu,Allen Nie,Ruijie Zheng,Aditya Modi,Adith Swaminathan,Ching-An Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 首次正式框架化学习从语言反馈（LLF）的问题，提出了传递排斥维度作为复杂性指标，并开发了HELiX算法，其性能与传递排斥维度相关。这开创了从语言反馈中设计互动学习算法的原则性设计的第一步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型代理的出现，从观察和语言反馈进行交互学习成为一个越来越受到重视的领域。但是，目前仍缺乏对这些决策问题的原则性框架。因此，提出了一种更为系统的理论结构和算法。

Method: 该研究通过正式化LLF问题，引入传递排斥维度作为复杂性量度，开发了无遗憾算法HELiX来解决这些问题，并通过一系列经验领域对其进行了验证。

Result: 在经验领域中，HELiX算法即使在反复提示LLM不可靠时也表现良好。研究表明，从丰富的语言反馈中学习可以比从奖励中学习快得多。

Conclusion: 该论文首次在理论上描述了从语言反馈学习（LLF）问题，并提出了传递排斥维度作为复杂性度量标准。介绍了一个无遗憾算法HELiX，其性能与问题的传递排斥维度有关。

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于小波的新方法，通过大规模预训练模型和统一多模态框架，提高了生理信号分析的性能和应用范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生理信号容易受到运动伪影、基线漂移等扰动影响，并表现出强的非平稳性，使传统方法难以有效分析。

Method: 引入了一种基于小波的新方法，用于分析多种生理信号的多尺度时间频率特征，并构建了大规模预训练模型和统一多模态框架。

Result: 提出的模型在多模态任务中表现优于现有方法，并显著提高了电肌图（EMG）和心电图（ECG）分析的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的新方法在处理低信噪比、多尺度时间频率特征的挑战时表现优异，并为生理信号分析设立了新的基准。

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推断材料反应的不可逆演变，解决RNN模型中的自一致性问题。

Method: 使用历史感知神经算子（HANO），一种基于傅里叶的神经算子骨干的自回归模型，并嵌入分层自注意机制。

Result: 在两个基准问题中，HANO在预测准确性、泛化和鲁棒性方面均表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: HANO表现优异，能够有效预测并模拟非弹性材料响应，适合与传统数值求解器集成。

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

Conclusion: 提出的TreeLoRA方法有效提高了大规模预训练模型在不断学习中的效率和效果。实验结果表明，该方法在视觉和自然语言处理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究介绍了PropInfer，一项用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）属性推断的基准任务，引入了两种攻击方法并成功揭示了LLM在微调后可能发生属性泄露的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管之前的工作研究了对判别模型和生成模型的属性推断攻击，但尚不清楚这种攻击是否会转移到大型语言模型（LLM）上。因此，本研究旨在探索LLM在微调后是否会暴露微调数据集中敏感的属性信息。

Method: 我们介绍了PropInfer，这是一项用于评估在两种微调模式（问答和聊天完成）下LLM的属性推断能力的基准任务。我们提出了两种定制的攻击方法：基于提示的生成攻击和利用词频信号的影子模型攻击。通过这些方法，我们在多个预训练的LLM上进行了实验评估。

Result: 我们的实验评估表明，我们提出的攻击在多个预训练LLM中能够成功实施，揭示了这些模型在微调数据集属性泄露上的潜在风险。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了在经过微调的大型语言模型（LLM）中存在的一个未被认知的脆弱性，即属性推断攻击可以成功地从这些模型中提取出关于微调数据集的敏感属性。我们所介绍的方法显示了这种攻击的可行性和危险性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Conclusion: 控制基础模型变化对于评估过程中至关重要，以准确揭示潜在模型能力之间的因果关系。

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Motivation: 针对在复杂体现任务中的奖励模型探索不足的问题，在EQA任务中引入更细致的空间、时间与逻辑理解评估。

Method: 提出了一种新的生成性多模态奖励模型EQA-RM，采用对比组相对策略优化（C-GRPO）策略进行训练，以学习细粒度行为区别。

Result: EQA-RM在700个样本上对EQA-RM-Bench达到了61.9%的准确率，超越了多个强大基线。

Conclusion: EQA-RM通过创新的C-GRPO策略和生成性多模态机制显著提升了EQA任务的奖励模型效果，可动态调整评估细节，实现了超过现有多种基线的性能。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs), vital for large model alignment, are underexplored for
complex embodied tasks like Embodied Question Answering (EQA) where nuanced
evaluation of agents' spatial, temporal, and logical understanding is critical
yet not considered by generic approaches. We introduce EQA-RM, a novel
generative multimodal reward model specifically architected for EQA, trained
via our innovative Contrastive Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)
strategy to learn fine-grained behavioral distinctions. The generative nature
of EQA-RM provides interpretable, structured reward feedback (beyond simple
scalars), uniquely enabling test-time scaling to dynamically adjust evaluation
granularity, from concise scores to detailed critiques of reasoning and
grounding, at inference without retraining. Concurrently, we introduce
EQARewardBench, a new benchmark built on OpenEQA for standardized EQA reward
model assessment. Demonstrating high sample efficiency, EQA-RM (fine-tuning
Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct) achieves 61.9\% accuracy on EQA-RM-Bench with only 700

Motivation: To address the challenges of high costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases associated with using LLMs to evaluate responses.

Method: Introduces PAJAMA, a system using LLMs to synthesize executable judging programs that can be stored and run locally.

Result: PAJAMA shows a 15.83% improvement in judgment consistency and a 23.7% reduction in biased responses on average. It also outperforms traditional methods on specific datasets with significantly lower cost.

Conclusion: PAJAMA can significantly reduce costs while improving judgment consistency and reducing biased responses compared to traditional LLM-as-a-judge methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM
generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API
costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To
address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model
Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging
programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can
be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing
interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a
model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of
RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the
JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

Motivation: 由于野火发生的增加，人们对野火传播预测的兴趣增长。然而，即使是最复杂的野火模型在多日模拟中也会与观测进程不同，因而需要数据同化。

Method: 研究中开发了一种方法，用于从VIIRS主动火灾测量、GOES衍生的点火时间和地形高度数据中估计火灾进程。训练了一个条件生成对抗网络，通过历史野火的模拟进行训练，从而在估算中纳入WRF-SFIRE物理模型。

Result: 方法在美国太平洋地区的五场野火中进行了验证，结果与通过飞机测量的高分辨率周长进行比较，发现平均Sorensen-Dice系数为0.81。

Conclusion: 地形高度对到达时间推断的影响很小，当推断中加入卫星测量时尤其如此。

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

Motivation: 现有的基准通常假设数据是整洁、规则采样的单模态，而实际应用中的时间序列数据常常是不规则的、多模态的、有很多缺失的部分，这导致研究与实际应用之间存在显著差距。

Method: 介绍了一个名为Time-IMM的数据集和一个名为IMM-TSF的基准库。Time-IMM专注于捕捉多模态时间序列中的因果驱动不规律性，并使用触发、约束和伪影机制分类了九种时间序列不规律类型。IMM-TSF是一种用于不规则多模态时间序列预测的基准库，支持异步集成和现实评价，并含有专门的融合模块。

Result: 实验证明，在不规则时间序列数据上显式建模多模态性显著提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: Time-IMM和IMM-TSF为在真实世界条件下进行时间序列分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

Motivation: 土壤有机碳（SOC）监测通常依赖于根据环境协变量选择具有代表性的田间采样位置。传统的cLHS方法可能忽略较小但重要的环境簇。

Method: 提出一种新的混合方法，将无监督机器学习技术的光谱聚类与条件拉丁超立方采样（cLHS）结合，以提高SOC采样的代表性。光谱聚类将研究区域划分为K个同质区，并在每个区域内应用cLHS以选择采样位置，从而共同捕捉环境条件的全部多样性。

Result: 实验证明，光谱-cLHS方法比标准cLHS提供了更均匀的协变量特征空间和空间异质性覆盖。

Conclusion: 该改进的采样设计通过为机器学习模型提供更均衡的训练数据，具有产出更准确SOC预测的潜力。

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

Result: The new framework MNN-LLM achieves a significant reduction in memory usage and accelerates inference speed by up to 8.6 times compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MNN-LLM significantly enhances the speed of large language model inference on mobile devices, achieving up to 8.6x speed increases compared to current frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
a variety of tasks. However, their substantial scale leads to significant
computational resource consumption during inference, resulting in high costs.
Consequently, edge device inference presents a promising solution. The primary
challenges of edge inference include memory usage and inference speed. This
paper introduces MNN-LLM, a framework specifically designed to accelerate the
deployment of large language models on mobile devices. MNN-LLM addresses the
runtime characteristics of LLMs through model quantization and DRAM-Flash
hybrid storage, effectively reducing memory usage. It rearranges weights and
inputs based on mobile CPU instruction sets and GPU characteristics while
employing strategies such as multicore load balancing, mixed-precision
floating-point operations, and geometric computations to enhance performance.
Notably, MNN-LLM achieves up to a 8.6x speed increase compared to current
mainstream LLM-specific frameworks.

Motivation: 当前在3D分子生成方面缺乏能够有效处理欧氏变换的扩散模型。

Method: 引入了一种名为Equivariant Neural Diffusion (END)的新型扩散模型，具有可学习的向前过程，并能适应欧氏变换。

Result: 在标准分子生成基准上进行的一系列实验中，END在无条件和有条件生成方面的性能与多个强基线方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: END模型提供了一种创新性的方法来生成3D分子，特别是在处理与欧氏变换相关的问题上表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce Equivariant Neural Diffusion (END), a novel diffusion model for
molecule generation in 3D that is equivariant to Euclidean transformations.
Compared to current state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models, the key
innovation in END lies in its learnable forward process for enhanced generative
modelling. Rather than pre-specified, the forward process is parameterized
through a time- and data-dependent transformation that is equivariant to rigid
transformations. Through a series of experiments on standard molecule
generation benchmarks, we demonstrate the competitive performance of END
compared to several strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional
generation.

Motivation: 研究机器学习模型在使用短历史训练窗口预测电力日前市场价格时的表现，特别是季节性趋势和价格尖峰的检测能力。

Method: 评估四种机器学习模型：LSTM与前馈纠错（FFEC）、XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost，利用从ENTSO-E预测数据中派生的特征集进行训练，训练窗口长度从7天到90天不等。

Result: LightGBM在多欧洲市场（希腊、比利时和爱尔兰）中表现出最高的预测准确性和鲁棒性，尤其是在45天和60天的训练窗口下，并且在季节性效应和峰值价格事件的检测中表现优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 短时间窗口的训练方法结合提升方法可以在数据稀缺的环境下有效支持电力日前市场价格的预测。

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of machine learning models in
forecasting electricity Day-Ahead Market (DAM) prices using short historical
training windows, with a focus on detecting seasonal trends and price spikes.
We evaluate four models, namely LSTM with Feed Forward Error Correction (FFEC),
XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, across three European energy markets (Greece,
Belgium, Ireland) using feature sets derived from ENTSO-E forecast data.
Training window lengths range from 7 to 90 days, allowing assessment of model
adaptability under constrained data availability. Results indicate that
LightGBM consistently achieves the highest forecasting accuracy and robustness,
particularly with 45 and 60 day training windows, which balance temporal
relevance and learning depth. Furthermore, LightGBM demonstrates superior
detection of seasonal effects and peak price events compared to LSTM and other
boosting models. These findings suggest that short-window training approaches,
combined with boosting methods, can effectively support DAM forecasting in
volatile, data-scarce environments.

Motivation: 提高电路的稳健性和可靠性，但由于熟练工程师的短缺和手动优化耗时，常常被忽视

Method: 将PCB原理图表示为二部图，并利用基于图神经网络（GNNs）的节点对预测模型进行自动化添加新元件的方法

Result: 不同的GNN架构在由人类专家标记的真实数据集上表现良好

Conclusion: GNN可以高精度地解决PCB设计优化问题，并有潜力以时间和成本高效的方式实现优化自动化

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design
optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

*Antonio Ferrara,Francesco Cozzi,Alan Perotti,André Panisson,Francesco Bonchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种尺寸自适应的假设检验框架，改进了算法决策系统的公平性评估，能够处理群体间的数据稀疏性问题，并提供统计严谨的决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的方法在比较公平性指标时忽略了抽样误差，并且没有考虑小型群体与大型群体的统计差异，尤其是在交叉分析中，数据变得过于稀疏，无法进行可靠的估计，导致过宽的置信区间，使得关于可能不公平待遇的结论难以确定。

Method: 我们提出了两个主要方法：(i) 对于足够大的子群体，证明了统计平等差异的中心极限定理，得到解析的置信区间和Wald检验，其I型（误报）错误保证为α水平。(ii) 对于小交叉群体的长尾，推导了完全贝叶斯Dirichlet-多项式估计器；蒙特卡罗可信区间针对任何样本尺寸进行了校准，并随着更多数据的可用性自然收敛至Wald区间。

Result: 我们的方法通过实证验证展示了在基准数据集上的应用，证明我们的测试能够在不同程度的数据可用性和交叉性下提供可解释且统计严谨的决策。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种统一的、尺寸自适应的假设检验框架，可以将公平性评估转化为基于证据的统计决策，并进行了实证验证，证明其能够在不同的数据可用性和交叉性水平下提供可解释的、严格的统计决策。

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

*Yu-Jie Zhang,Peng Zhao,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文在非平稳在线学习中，通过利用可混合性改进了动态遗憾界限，提出了更优的分析框架，处理了具有更强曲率的损失函数问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在非平稳在线学习中取得了相当大的进展，但动态遗憾最小化主要集中在凸函数上，对于具有更强曲率的函数(如平方或逻辑损失)却仍未充分探讨。

Method: 采用一种带有固定共享更新的指数权重方法，以此来处理可混合损失问题。

Result: 对于可混合损失，本文的方法实现了动态遗憾为 $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$，优于此前最佳的 $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ 结果。

Conclusion: 本文通过利用可混合性概念改进了非平稳在线学习的动态遗憾界限，展示了在更强曲率的损失函数（例如平方或逻辑损失）条件下，可以显著减少遗憾。

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纸质心电图记录中的信号重叠问题，提高数据数字化的准确性。

Method: 提出一个两阶段管道，包括一个基于U-Net的分割网络和一个时间序列信号转换模块，解决信号重叠的问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，U-Net架构在细粒度分割任务中达到0.87的IoU，所提出的方法在非重叠和重叠数据样本中均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种有效策略，大幅提升了数字化精度，特别是在信号重叠情况下，奠定了可靠的数字化心电图记录转化基础。

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

Motivation: 传统的图学习问题在维度较大时难以处理，因此需要一种能够优化大规模数据的图学习方法。

Method: 该论文提出了一种图学习框架，该框架利用条件相关矩阵的低秩分解，并使用黎曼优化技术来解决相应的优化问题。

Result: 通过对合成数据和真实数据的实验表明，该方法在维度和性能之间可以达到非常高效的权衡。

Conclusion: 采用低秩分解方法能有效解决大规模维度问题，并能在维度和性能之间取得高效的权衡。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

Motivation: 解决现有的无监督强化学习方法MISL在理论分析中的不足，例如学习到的技能如何初始化下游任务的策略。

Method: 通过提出新的解缠度量LSEPIN，并用Wasserstein距离替换信息几何中的KL散度，开发了新的技能学习目标WSEP；还提出了基于Wasserstein距离的算法PWSEP。

Result: 理论上证明了WSEP有利于下游任务的适应，比MISL能够发现更多初始策略。PWSEP可以理论上发现所有最优的初始策略。

Conclusion: 学习技能的多样性和可分离性对下游任务适应性至关重要，但MISL不一定保证这些性质。新的方法WSEP和PWSEP能够帮助适应下游任务。

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed Time-R1 framework improves LLMs' multi-step reasoning in time series forecasting, showing better results across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series forecasting methods are largely based on fast thinking paradigms and lack an explicit slow thinking process for intermediate reasoning, which limits their multi-step reasoning capabilities, and prompt engineering alone is insufficient due to limitations such as high computational cost and privacy risks.

Method: Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. It includes a fine-grained multi-objective reward and GRIP for policy optimization.

Result: Time-R1 enhances multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs, leading to better generalization and forecast performance.

Conclusion: Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

Conclusion: 研究提供了关于扩散模型潜在空间复杂结构及其与相变等现象的联系的新见解。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究表明，尽管CoT增强了transformer模型解决复杂问题的能力，但在真实世界中，训练和测试数据分布及无污染数据的假设不一定成立，因此需要研究数据分布转移对模型性能的具体影响。

Method: 调查数据分布和数据污染对通过CoT方法训练得到的模型质量的联合影响，特别是针对k-奇偶校验问题。

Result: 发现CoT技术在学习奇偶校验时比直接生成预测的效果更差，并提供了对此影响的机械性原因的详尽解释。

Conclusion: Chain of Thought (CoT)技术在有数据分布转移和数据污染情况下可能导致模型性能下降。

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

Motivation: 神经系统在连续学习过程中常面临灾难性遗忘的问题，而自组织映射（SOMs）虽然在可解释性和效率方面具有优势，却也无法避免这个问题。

Method: 引入了一种饱和自组织映射（SatSOM），通过一种新颖的饱和机制逐步降低神经元的学习率和邻域半径，从而在连续学习场景中改善知识保留。

Result: 该方法可以有效冻结训练良好的神经元，并将学习重定向到映射中未充分利用的区域。

Conclusion: SatSOM通过逐步调整学习率和邻域半径，优化了SOM在连续学习中的知识保留能力。

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

Motivation: 现有的方法在去除不必要的概念时，常常也降低了有用信号的质量，因此需要一种能够同时去除不必要的概念并保护重要信号的方法。

Method: 提出了一种称为SPLICE的方法，通过交错投影技术去除不需要的方向，同时保护重要标签的相关性。

Result: 在Bias in Bios和Winobias等基准上，SPLICE相比现有方法效果更好，能够去除敏感属性，同时仅对主要任务信息造成最小的破坏。

Conclusion: SPLICE能够成功去除神经网络表示中的敏感概念，同时保护与目标标签的协方差关系。

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

Conclusion: ConTextTab通过结合表格原生ICL框架与深度语义理解，提升了在语义丰富的数据集上的表现，并在多个基准测试中达到了竞争性的性能。

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合句子级证据识别与答案合成的优化方法，在临床问答中表现优异，达到了51.5的总分，并在BioNLP 2025竞赛中获得亚军。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化的电子健康记录问答系统可以弥补临床医生和患者之间的重要信息差距，因此需要精确的证据检索和在有限监督下的可信答案生成。

Method: 将任务分为（1）句子级别证据识别和（2）包含显式引用的答案合成两个部分。对每个阶段，使用DSPy's MIPROv2优化器自动探索提示空间，并联合调整指令和少样本演示。通过自一致性投票方案进一步提高证据召回率，同时不牺牲精度。

Result: 在隐藏测试集上，该方法获得了51.5的总体得分，名列第二，并超过标准的零样本和少样本提示方法分别超过20和10个百分点。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种数据驱动的提示优化方法，作为模型微调的成本效益替代方案，提高了高风险临床问答的可靠性。

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用机器学习方法进行天气预测近年来因为比传统数值天气预报（NWP）更准确、更快速而受到关注，并且已经在全球概率天气预报中超过传统的集成方法。

Method: 论文提出的FGN是一种简单、可扩展且灵活的建模方法，通过学习的模型扰动和一组适当约束的模型生成集成，直接训练以最小化位置预测的连续等级概率得分（CRPS）。

Result: FGN在多种确定性和概率性指标下提供了最先进的集成预测，并能够生成有技能的热带气旋轨迹预测，尽管只在边际上进行训练，但能捕捉到联合的空间结构。

Conclusion: FGN显著超过了当前最先进的天气预测模型，展示了其在全球概率天气预报中的优越性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based weather models have rapidly risen to prominence
due to their greater accuracy and speed than traditional forecasts based on
numerical weather prediction (NWP), recently outperforming traditional
ensembles in global probabilistic weather forecasting. This paper presents FGN,
a simple, scalable and flexible modeling approach which significantly
outperforms the current state-of-the-art models. FGN generates ensembles via
learned model-perturbations with an ensemble of appropriately constrained
models. It is trained directly to minimize the continuous rank probability
score (CRPS) of per-location forecasts. It produces state-of-the-art ensemble
forecasts as measured by a range of deterministic and probabilistic metrics,
makes skillful ensemble tropical cyclone track predictions, and captures joint
spatial structure despite being trained only on marginals.

Motivation: 找到一个误差尽可能小的单调分类函数。

Method: 本文通过研究输入点的隐藏标签揭示来定义算法的成本，并提出了单调分类器的误差上下界。

Result: 给出了适用于所有ε值的单调分类器的上下界。

Conclusion: 本文首次研究了单调分类问题中寻找单调分类器的最低成本。

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Dense Associative Memory networks by enabling exact memory retrieval with exponential capacity and introduce emergent local minima for enhanced creativity.

Method: A novel energy function (log-sum-ReLU) inspired by Epanechnikov kernel for Dense Associative Memory networks.

Result: LSR energy reveals more local minima with comparable log-likelihood to existing models and shows creativity and novelty on image datasets.

Conclusion: LSR energy exhibits significantly more emergent local minima while preserving pattern recovery, offering potential for large-scale memory storage and generative tasks.

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

Conclusion: 研究表明当前的DDLS存在很大效率攻击风险，现有的防御机制无法有效抵御。因此，迫切需要开发新的缓解策略以保障未来自适应DDLS的安全性。

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过分析无模型强化学习中的熵正则化和约束惩罚，实现对不确定性扰动下状态约束的鲁棒安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，强化学习取得了许多进展，但在未知扰动下学习鲁棒地满足状态约束的政策仍然是一个未解决的问题。本文提出一种新方法，通过分析无模型强化学习中两种成熟技术（熵正则化和约束惩罚）的相互作用，实现鲁棒安全性。

Method: 分析了无模型强化学习中的熵正则化技术和约束惩罚技术，揭示了熵正则化在约束条件下如何偏向于最大化未来可行动作数量，从而提升对动作噪声的约束满足。此外，通过惩罚放松严格约束，将约束强化学习问题近似为无约束问题，进而使用标准无模型强化学习进行求解。

Result: 通过惩罚放松严格约束，可以将约束强化学习问题近似为无约束问题，从而利用标准无模型强化学习求解。此重构方法在保持安全性和最优性的同时，经验上提高了对扰动的抗干扰能力。

Conclusion: 结果表明，约束强化学习中的熵正则化与鲁棒性的联系是一个有前景的研究方向，可以通过简单的奖励塑造实现强化学习中的鲁棒安全性。

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

TL;DR: NoLoCo是一种减少通信开销的新优化方法，通过隐式同步模型参数提高训练效率并加速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大模型训练需要在高带宽互联网上进行大量通信，该过程费用昂贵并且在低带宽网络中效率低下。因此，需要减少通信密集型的方法来进行训练。

Method: NoLoCo使用一种变体的Nesterov动量优化器，通过随机选择并部分平均模型权重来实现隐式同步，无需显式同步所有模型参数。

Result: NoLoCo在多种加速器数量和模型规模下进行了基准测试，显示其通信开销显著低于完全分片数据并行训练以及DiLoCo。此外，在没有全局阻塞通信的情况下，加速器空闲时间减少了，且在某些情况下收敛速度提高最高达4%。

Conclusion: NoLoCo的优化方法显著减少了训练期间的通信开销，并在没有全局阻塞通信的情况下提高了训练收敛速度。

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

Conclusion: CausalFM可能会从根本上改变实务人员在医学、经济学和其他学科中进行因果推断的方法。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

Conclusion: 采用内部偏差减轻措施可以有效降低大语言模型在招聘应用中的偏差问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

TL;DR: SEAL is a framework for LLMs to self-adapt through self-generated finetuning data, using a reinforcement learning loop for optimization. It allows LLMs to self-direct their adaptation, proving effective in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. This paper aims to introduce a framework for LLMs to self-adapt.

Method: SEAL enables LLMs to self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. It uses supervised finetuning (SFT) and a reinforcement learning loop with downstream performance as the reward signal.

Result: Experiments on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization demonstrate that SEAL is effective in enabling self-directed adaptation of language models.

Conclusion: SEAL is a promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our

TL;DR: GUARD通过指导性数据归因提高LLM在不需要遗忘的数据上的实用性保留，减少了不必要的信息丢失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对LLM在数据移除过程中出现的非预期遗忘问题，提升模型的实用性和信息保留能力。

Method: 引入轻量级代理数据归因指标，通过重新分配遗忘权重来减少信息丢失。

Result: 在TOFU基准测试的多种LLM架构上，GUARD减少了信息保留集的实用性损失，在遗忘训练数据10%时提高了真相比率达194.92%。

Conclusion: GUARD框架显著增强了大型语言模型在数据移除后信息保留的能力，同时保持与之前方法相当的遗忘性能。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在代码生成方面展示了出色的能力，但通常在推理过程中未能利用执行反馈，而这是人类程序员经常使用的重要信号。

Method: 通过执行引导的分类器自由引导（EG-CFG），在代码生成过程中动态整合执行信号，提供逐行反馈，引导生成过程。方法包括多阶段过程：首先进行波束搜索以采样候选程序完成，然后执行这些候选程序以提取执行信号，最后在生成过程中将这些信号整合到提示中。

Result: 实验表明，EG-CFG方法在各种编码任务中的代码生成性能显著优于标准方法，在从基础问题到具有挑战性的竞争性编程任务中均实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: EG-CFG方法显著提升了代码生成性能，在不同复杂度的编码任务中取得了最先进的成果。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

*Aayush Karan,Kulin Shah,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGuidance boosts realism and rewards for diffusion-based methods, excelling in difficult inverse problems with theoretical backing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training-free methods like diffusion posterior sampling struggle with hard inverse problems and low signal-to-noise ratios. There's a need for better techniques to maintain data manifold alignment and produce realistic outputs.

Method: ReGuidance is a wrapper method that improves sample realism and reward for diffusion-based techniques by reversing unconditional probability flow ODE from a candidate solution, using it to initialize diffusion posterior sampling.

Result: ReGuidance demonstrated significant improvement in sample quality and measurement consistency in tasks like large box in-painting and super-resolution. Theoretical analysis shows improved reward and alignment to the data manifold.

Conclusion: ReGuidance significantly enhances performance in solving hard inverse problems by improving sample realism and measurement consistency, offering a first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS methods.

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Motivation: 理解上下文学习在结构化几何数据中的表现，并探讨注意力机制与传统核方法之间的关系。

Method: 通过将注意力机制与传统核方法相结合，研究Hölder函数在流形上的回归问题，并推导一般化误差界。

Result: 当观察到足够数量的训练任务时，变压器可以实现流形上Hölder函数的最小最大回归率。研究结果揭示了一般化误差随训练任务数量变化的规律。

Conclusion: 研究为理解上下文学习中的几何角色和非线性模型提供了基础性见解和新工具。

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型训练昂贵且小规模实验得出的见解常常很难应用于耗费资源的生产系统中，这阻碍了高效创新。

Method: 通过系统地构建模型损失曲面L(N,D)，Farseer提供更高的预测准确性，并与之前的缩放法则（如Chinchilla's law）对比，显著降低外推误差。

Result: Farseer在各个规模水平上实现了优秀的外推能力，将预测误差减少了433%，并且提供了关于现代大语言模型训练中优化计算分配的新见解。

Conclusion: Farseer可以可靠地评估不同训练策略在各个规模下的竞争力，并且能够将小规模实验得出的结论自信地外推到大规模系统中，促进LLM训练的优化和创新。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

Motivation: 探讨LV损失在扩散桥中的应用缺乏合理的优化目标，而rKL-LD损失能够避免这种问题并可能带来更好的性能。

Method: 研究使用rKL损失结合log微分技巧（rKL-LD）的效果，相比使用LV损失的效果进行比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，在各种具有挑战性的基准测试中，使用rKL-LD损失训练的扩散桥采样器表现优于使用LV损失的采样器。

Conclusion: 使用rKL-LD（rKL损失函数结合log微分技巧）不仅解决了使用LV损失的概念问题，还在实践中表现出更好的性能和稳定的训练效率。

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

Motivation: 在高维分类任务中，尤其是在响应变量类别不平衡和数据维度不对称的双重不平衡条件下，传统的基于随机森林的特征选择方法常常产生不稳定或误导性的特征重要性排名。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于最小深度的特征选择新阈值方案，利用树结构来评估变量的重要性。

Result: 通过在模拟和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验，证明该方法相较于传统的基于最小深度的选择方法，能得到更简约且准确的变量子集。

Conclusion: 该方法为在双重不平衡条件下的随机森林中的变量选择提供了一个实用且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in high-dimensional classification
tasks, particularly under challenging conditions of double imbalance, namely
settings characterized by both class imbalance in the response variable and
dimensional asymmetry in the data $(n \gg p)$. In such scenarios, traditional
feature selection methods applied to Random Forests (RF) often yield unstable
or misleading importance rankings. This paper proposes a novel thresholding
scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth, which exploits the tree
topology to assess variable relevance. Extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more
parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal
depth-based selection. The method provides a practical and interpretable
solution for variable selection in RF under double imbalance conditions.

Result: 分析表明，特定任务存在权衡：专用的单细胞框架（如 scVI、CLAIRE 和微调的 scGPT）在单模态批次校正方面表现出色，而通用 SSL 方法（如 VICReg 和 SimCLR）在细胞类型识别和多模态数据融合集成方面表现更优。随机掩蔽被认为是在所有任务中最有效的数据增强技术，优于领域特定的增强方法。

Conclusion: scSSL-Bench 提供了一个标准化的评估平台，并为将自监督学习（SSL）应用于单细胞分析提供了具体的建议，促进了深度学习与单细胞基因组学的融合。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data
integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform
and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis,
advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.

Method: 本文介绍了一组名为Nullsettes的预测任务，用于评估模型预测因转移合成表达盒中关键控制元件而引起的功能缺失突变的能力。

Result: 在对12种最先进的模型进行研究后发现，变异效应预测性能与非突变序列的预测似然性有很强的相关性。此外，能预测出强模型性能的似然值范围高度依赖于序列长度。

Conclusion: 研究表明，使用基因组语言模型进行变异效应预测时，序列的似然性和长度都需要被纳入考虑，以提高预测性能。

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning
high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we
consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance.
We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex
within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the
true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2)
e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new
information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV
distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3
\sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the
noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge
\Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We
resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge
\Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our
analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and
introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy
observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.

*Panagiotis Theodoropoulos,Augustinos D. Saravanos,Evangelos A. Theodorou,Guan-Horng Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 3MSBM is a new framework that outperforms existing methods in capturing complex temporal dynamics by learning smooth measure-valued splines, enhancing convergence and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methodologies struggle to infer trajectories from sparse snapshots due to reliance on pairwise interpolation, limiting their ability to capture long-range temporal dependencies.

Method: 3MSBM learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems by lifting the dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to multiple positional constraints. It learns transport maps that preserve intermediate marginals, enhancing convergence and scalability.

Result: Through extensive experimentation, 3MSBM demonstrates superior performance in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies.

Conclusion: 3MSBM significantly improves the ability to capture complex dynamics with temporal dependencies compared to existing methods, opening new avenues for matching frameworks in multi-marginal settings.

Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample
snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g.,
single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge
and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise
interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture
long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the
inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum
Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching
framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that
satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the
dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned
on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal
control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a
variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal
conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that
preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving
convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of
real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to
existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies,
opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal
settings.

Motivation: 填补对抗性到随机性在线学习之间的差距，并提供对学习设置的细粒的理解。

Method: 研究了分布约束的对抗者框架，分析了可学习的分布类别，并提供了此背景下对遗忘和自适应对抗者的学习特征。

Conclusion: 论文在对抗性到随机性在线学习的研究中，提出了一个更通用和灵活的框架。这个框架可以在不需要任何分布类别的先验知识下实现学习者的竞争能力。

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成图像的语义和结构特征在扩散过程的逆向动态中出现的时间差异，并与物理相变联系起来。

Method: 采用一般信息论方法，通过在线公式进行贝叶斯分类估计，在给定噪声状态下估计类标签的条件熵。利用条件熵的时间导数确定噪声状态和类标签之间信息传输的时间间隔。

Result: 在一维高斯混合模型和DDPM模型（基于CIFAR10数据集训练）上验证该方法。结果表明，语义信息传输在扩散的中间阶段最为明显，在最后阶段趋于消失。不同类别的熵率差异巨大，表明不同的语义决策位于不同的中间时间。

Conclusion: 语义信息在扩散的中间阶段迁移最为明显，不同类的决策呈现出不同的时间分布特征。

Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated
images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a
phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and
other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic
approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the
generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian
classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the
noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest
information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time
derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on
one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the
CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is
highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the
final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate
profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions"
are located at different intermediate times.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了BCSoftmax函数，能够增强模型输出概率约束，并改善模型自信度，从而提高决策任务的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Softmax函数无法在概率输出上施加严格约束的问题，因为在某些需要可靠和可信赖的模型的应用中，硬约束是必要的。

Method: 提出了一种新的BCSoftmax函数，使用基于box约束的优化算法，并且开发了精确和高效的计算算法以及两个基于BCSoftmax的后处理校准方法，以解决模型的过度自信或不自信问题。

Result: 在TinyImageNet、CIFAR-100和20NewsGroups数据集上的实验表明，使用BCSoftmax可以在校准度量上取得改进。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的算法BCSoftmax，可以有效地改善机器学习模型输出概率的约束问题，提高模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common
problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function
provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to
enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities,
which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and
trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax
($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on
output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution
to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient
computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we
introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The
proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive
models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or
logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream
decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods
experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets,
achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

Result: 通过在不同场景的实验证明，自适应数据收集能够显著提升学习性能，特别是在允许中间策略部署的情况下。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在静态环境中与领先的线下方法性能相当，并且在允许中间策略部署时显著优于这些方法。经验评估表明，自适应数据收集的优势及PAC-Bayesian公式的强大性能。

Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal
policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In
this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive
off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to
collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning
with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to
the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally
accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates
under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline
approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when
intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across
diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and
the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种改进的无偏离线估计方法，可以显著降低A/B测试中差异均值估计器的方差。在被测试的两个系统表现出相似性的情况下，该估计器性能尤为出色。

Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating
the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a
baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each
exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the
difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the
commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.
We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower
variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the
estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and
offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit
similarities. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该研究通过谱特征方法，在潜在混杂因素存在的情况下，有效地进行因果效应估计，同时识别方法的性能和失败情形。

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We
derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator
based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and
failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to
a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This
occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is
well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled
with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument.
Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but
rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly
more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario,
weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the
eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate
this taxonomy.

Conclusion: 该方法能够以高概率保证整体标注错误较小，实现严谨且高效的数据集管理。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is often costly, requiring either
extensive human annotation or expensive experiments. We propose a method that
supplements such "expert" labels with AI predictions from pre-trained models to
construct labeled datasets more cost-effectively. Our approach results in
probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall
labeling error is small. This solution enables rigorous yet efficient dataset
curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology
through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with
pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.

Motivation: 研究掩码离散扩散模型中的无分类器引导（CFG），以更好地理解引导如何影响采样行为，特别是在目标是从特定类进行采样时。

Method: 假设没有得分错误和离散化错误，通过明确求解引导反向动力学，探讨引导对采样行为的影响，以及不同引导强度如何导致样本分布中协方差结构的变化。

Result: 发现引导不仅影响输出分布，还控制采样轨迹的动态，且在1D和2D中表现出定量的不同行为。对于大引导强度，TV的衰减率在反向动力学中呈双指数增长，理论分析得到实验验证。

Conclusion: 引导在塑造输出分布和控制采样轨迹动态方面扮演了重要角色，通过实验验证了理论发现。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit
solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the
sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data
distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a
specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses
regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength
$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.
Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We
also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation
($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for
both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in
shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the
sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that
illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的扩散模型在应用于物理约束计算地震成像时存在不稳定性，尤其是在非线性求解器（如全波形反演）中，波在噪声速度场中传播会导致数值伪影和反演质量差的问题。为解决这一挑战，本文提出了一种整合DDPM作为扩散先验的简化框架。

Method: 本文提出了一种直接将预训练的去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）作为得分生成扩散先验，采用得分重新匹配策略来集成到全波形反演（FWI）过程的方法。该方法避免了传统扩散方法中的反向扩散采样，并在干净图像空间中进行图像反演。此外，该方法通过在标准FWI更新规则中引入一个简单的正则项，促成稳定的波传播和反演质量的提高。

Result: 数值实验表明，所提出的方法相比于传统和基于GAN的全波形反演方法，提供了增强的保真度和鲁棒性，同时在地震成像和其他逆问题任务中具有实际和计算效率。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种简单而有效的方法，将预训练的去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）作为得分生成扩散先验直接集成到全波形反演（FWI）中，通过得分重新匹配策略来实现。这种方法无需进行反向扩散采样，减少了迭代次数，并能够在干净的图像空间内完成成像反演。实验结果表明，该方法相比传统和基于GAN的FWI方法在保真度和鲁棒性方面有显著提高，同时在计算效率上具备实际应用价值。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors
for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the
full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,
which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.
In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those
used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy
velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates
a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based
generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike
traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion
sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in
the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity
models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple
regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal
modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation
and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical
experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and
robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while
remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other
inverse problem tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究结果表明，通过对信号光线路径形状的分析、光线追踪散射高度和雷达测量的多普勒速度参数来识别分类的重要性。

Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for
processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based
only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio
wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating
the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data
obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for
each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the
classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave
propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the
radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made
using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal
number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The
analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently
separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of
10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and
their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of
solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not
contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most
important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal
ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and
the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance
for future research in this rapidly evolving area. For more information,

Result: 将此建模为回归任务可以提高性能，且均方误差更好地保留激活空间中的有意义方向信息。

Conclusion: 结合MusicGen中的文本提示的全局条件，我们的方法在音乐生成中提供全局和局部控制。

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through
inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer
called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and
genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes
trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar
manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved
performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有声学掩蔽技术在掩盖环境噪声时常常需要过高的音量，而结合最近跨模态生成的进展，提出一种新方法来将噪声与个性化生成的音乐融合。

Method: 提出了BNMusic框架，首先生成包含噪声音乐精髓的mel频谱图的完整音乐片段，随后自适应放大生成的音乐以进一步减少噪声感知并增强融合效果，同时保持声音质量。

Result: 实验表明BNMusic框架能够成功地将环境噪声与节奏对齐、自适应放大和令人愉悦的音乐片段融合，有效地减少噪声的可察觉性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究展示了BNMusic框架能够有效地将环境噪声与个性化生成的音乐融合，减少噪声的可察觉性，并改善整体听觉体验。

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Motivation: 研究幸福概念的传统定义与现代理解的差异，尤其是在与他人互动时，个体如何权衡个人幸福与他人幸福。

Method: 研究个体（称为homo-felix）在博弈中的收益及其与互动个体的幸福程度对自己幸福的影响。分析简单情境下的幸福反馈回路，并使用简单的2x2博弈论模型及n人公共物品博弈进行验证。

Result: homo-felix在简单的博弈论环境中可以达到多种均衡状态，这些状态不仅包括纳什均衡。在多人公共物品博弈中，单个个体的亲社会行为能够显著影响整个群体的行为倾向。

Conclusion: 个体往往会更在意那些较为快乐的个体，即便这样做的结果不如自私行事令他们自身更快乐。在多人公共物品博弈中，非合作纳什均衡是边际不稳定的，一个具有亲社会行为的个体能够将几乎整个群体引导至合作状态。

Abstract: Happiness, in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, was understood quite
differently from today's popular notions of personal pleasure. Happiness
implies a flourishing life - one of virtue, purpose, and contribution to the
common good. This paper studies populations of individuals - that we call
homo-felix - who maximise an objective function that we call happiness. The
happiness of one individual depends on the payoffs that they receive in games
they play with their peers as well as on the happiness of the peers they
interact with. Individuals care more or less about others depending on whether
that makes them more or less happy. This paper analyses the happiness feedback
loops that result from these interactions in simple settings. We find that
individuals tend to care more about individuals who are happier than what they
would be by being selfish. In simple 2 x 2 game theoretic settings, we show
that homo-felix can converge to a variety of equilibria which includes but goes
beyond Nash equilibria. In an n-persons public good game we show that the
non-cooperative Nash equilibrium is marginally unstable and a single individual
who develops prosocial behaviour is able to drive almost the whole population
to a cooperative state.

Abstract: Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or
phrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been
dedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines
of research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case
scenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as
there has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,
we bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on
keyphrase generation, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress,
limitations, and open challenges. Our findings highlight several critical
issues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among
commonly-used benchmark datasets and inconsistencies in metric calculations
leading to overestimated performances. Additionally, we address the limited
availability of pre-trained models by releasing a strong PLM-based model for
keyphrase generation as an effort to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR)
systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be
challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well
retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.
Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to
generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs
to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous
work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have
the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is
needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the
reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs
are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we
examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are
used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in
evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.
We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects
model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation
results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for
e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as
significant in comparing relative system performance. Codes and data are

TL;DR: 为了解决GNN方法在矩阵补全中容易过拟合的问题，提出了MCCL，该方法在去噪及特征对齐上进行了改进，并在多个数据集上取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于GNN的方法对噪声或不相关边敏感，且易过拟合，影响普适性。

Method: MCCL首先为每个交互提取局部邻域子图，并通过两种不同的图表示进行生成。第一种强调去噪，结合了GNN层和注意力机制；第二种通过图变分自编码器对特征分布进行标准化。训练过程中，通过互学习损失函数协调这两种表示的和谐。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，我们的方法在预测得分准确性上获得了最高0.8%的RMSE改进，并在排名指标上提高了最多36%。

Conclusion: 我们提出的MCCL方法有效地提高了推荐系统中评分预测的准确性和排名质量。

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as
predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a
comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural
network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant
edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to
overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning
(MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each
interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The
first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an
attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational
autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A
mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually
harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns
and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on
several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the
numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement
in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in
ranking metrics.

Motivation: 现有的基于GNN的KGRS在稀疏交互下即使使用SSL也不能保持其优越的性能，而更复杂的模型在稀疏交互场景中的表现更差。

Method: LightKG包含一个简化的GNN层，使用线性聚合框架进行编码，并集成高效的对比层以实施SSL。它通过直接最小化原始图中的节点相似性来避免繁琐的子图生成和比较。

Result: 实验表明LightKG在四个基准数据集上的表现优于12个竞争对手，并显著缩短了训练时间。

Conclusion: LightKG在稀疏和密集场景下的表现优于其他竞争对手，同时显著减少了训练时间。具体而言，在推荐准确性上平均超过了最佳基线5.8%，并节省了84.3%的训练时间。

Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for
Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven
effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training
time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to
other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior
performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models
tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,
like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning
difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet
powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a
simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather
than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly
reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an
efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node
similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation
and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and
dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it
surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy
and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LTV预测框架SHORE，通过短期预测增强长期目标，并通过混合损失函数提高预测的稳健性，显著降低了预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字游戏中，长期用户生命周期价值（LTV）的预测对货币化策略至关重要。然而，由于支付行为的延迟、早期用户数据稀疏以及高价值异常值的存在，这一预测面临重大挑战。

Method: SHORE (SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression) 是一种新的LTV预测框架，它通过将短周期预测（如 LTV-15 和 LTV-30）作为辅助任务，与长周期目标（如 LTV-60）结合。它还引入了一个混合损失函数，结合保序多类分类和动态Huber损失来减轻零膨胀和异常支付行为的影响。

Result: SHORE在真实世界数据集上的广泛离线和在线实验表明，与现有基线相比，它在在线部署中显著地减少了47.91%的预测误差。

Conclusion: SHORE框架在工业规模的数字游戏LTV预测中表现出实际的有效性和稳健性。

Abstract: In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is
essential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to
delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of
high-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle
observations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often
underestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these
issues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression
(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon
predictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle
targets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining
order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to
mitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.
Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\%
relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment. These results
highlight SHORE's practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale
LTV prediction for digital games.

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant
challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs.
Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures,
relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding
graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In
this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first
approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific
macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts.
Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the
first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information
effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate
macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering
multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender
system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark
datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning
methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based
recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE
in billion-scale recommender systems.

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入全局参考比较，提高了点状文档排序方法的有效性，同时保持了较高的效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting
strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high
effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for
larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior
efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores
for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical
comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of
pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key
innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise
Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between
each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.
We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of
pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by
capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive
relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise
methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a
training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR
benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous
pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also
achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require
substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the
efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

Motivation: 为了克服在训练过程中直接生成目标字幕时出现的字幕变异问题，该研究提出了一种新的音频理解模型。通过训练模型生成类似对话的响应，可以更有效地捕捉字幕的深层含义。

Method: 提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）的对话延续能力的方法。在训练过程中，模型不会直接生成目标字幕，而是生成一种将输入字幕视为引发对话的响应。

Result: 实验表明，该模型即使仅在音频字幕数据集上训练，也能够进行零样本的指令追踪。在AudioCaps、WavCaps和Clotho数据集上的实验以及AudioBench音频场景问答测试中，展示了该模型理解和跟随多种未见指令的能力。

Conclusion: 通过对话延续训练，提高了模型的字幕理解能力，实现了不依赖多任务指令调优的零样本指令追踪能力。

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

*Rogier C. van Dalen,Shucong Zhang,Titouan Parcollet,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 通过引入新损失函数和说话者编码，该文在说话者自适应方面实现了在极少数据下的显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的语音识别器通常只能在特定环境下表现最佳，需要适应才能在其他环境中有效工作。而对于新的说话者，自适应往往面临数据不足且无标签的问题。此论文的动机是在极少数据的情况下提高自适应的稳健性。

Method: 该论文提出了一种结合多种方法的新方案，使得自适应仅需一分钟的数据即可表现稳定。具体方法包括：提出了一种新的损失函数——完整假设的条件熵，以替代以往基于单个假设或"伪标签"的交叉熵估计。同时，引入"说话者编码"以便使用较少数据表征说话者。

Result: 在对Common Voice的远场噪声增强版本进行测试时，提出的方法使用1分钟的自适应数据实现了20%的单词错误率相对提升，使用10分钟的数据则提升至29%。

Conclusion: 本文中的方法显著提高了在较少数据情况下（如1分钟和10分钟）的自适应性能。

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

TL;DR: 研究设施选址的策略机制，证明无法限制最优Gini指数的近似比，提出新的评估方法包括互补Gini指数和Nash福利。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨设施选址中最大化代理之间公平性的策略机制。

Method: 使用决策理论中的Gini指数作为衡量公平性的标准，通过计算互补的Gini指数来评估确定性和随机性的机制。

Result: 证明了在策略机制中无法限制最优Gini指数的近似比，并提出了新的近似方法。同时考察机制对Nash福利的近似情况。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的设施选址策略机制，该机制解决了以往方法无法限制近似比的问题，并通过互补Gini指数及Nash福利进行评估。

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

TL;DR: 研究开发了首个检测新法西斯主义话语的分类模型，并强调需要积极反对这种政治运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新法西斯主义在美国及其他西方社会的显著增长，对民主和少数群体构成了严重威胁，需要采取积极措施以防止事态升级。

Method: 提出了一种独特的新法西斯主义编码方案，用于美国社会数字话语分析，并通过收集和标记网络活动数据来测试该方案。同时，使用小型和大型语言模型对标记的数据集进行微调和测试，开发出首个用于新法西斯主义话语的分类模型。

Result: 发现新法西斯主义修辞在这些论坛中普遍存在，强调了进一步研究的必要性。

Conclusion: 反对新法西斯主义的工作需持续推进，保障民主社会的福祉。

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化学习在在线环境中至关重要，尤其是通过为学习者提供定制回答来提高参与度并减轻教师负担。

Method: 使用StackExchange平台进行语言学习和编程的全面研究，开发框架和数据集以验证自动生成的个性化答案，通过0-shot、1-shot和few-shot策略生成个性化答案，并使用BERTScore、LLM评价和人类评价三种方法进行评估。

Result: 研究结果表明，向LLMs提供期望答案的示例能够提升其定制回答能力。

Conclusion: 提供LLMs示例回答可以显著提升其根据个体学习者需求定制回答的能力。

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and
accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is
crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings.
A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized
to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners'
questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators.
To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a
comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas:
language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for
validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we
generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot,
1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using
three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our
findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from
the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to
tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了AI5GTest，一个AI驱动的框架，简化和自动化O-RAN组件的验证过程，具有高效性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决O-RAN多供应商组件验证中手动流程繁琐且易出错的问题。

Method: AI5GTest是一个基于AI的大型语言模型框架，包括Gen-LLM、Val-LLM和Debug-LLM，以自动化验证O-RAN组件。

Result: 评估显示，与传统手动方法相比，AI5GTest显著减少了整体测试执行时间，并保持高准确率。

Conclusion: AI5GTest自动化框架大大减少了测试执行时间，同时保持了高验证准确率。

Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the
telecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,
and rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces
complex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components
against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as
those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on
manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to
inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present
AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to
automate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative
Large Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and
Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test
cases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references
signaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect
deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,
providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and
trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for
approval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test
cases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest
demonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to
traditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 月球表面的无线通信系统需要自适应性和鲁棒性，以应对环境变化和任务需求。而目前的Space-O-RAN系统在决策逻辑上仍然局限于静态策略，缺乏语义集成。

Method: 使用模型上下文协议（MCP）和代理对代理（A2A）通信协议，部署分布式认知代理，从而在无线通信系统中实现实时、近实时和非实时控制层的上下文感知决策。

Result: 实现了分布式认知代理在各类月球设备中的部署，能够通过语境感知的方式进行决策和优化通信策略，并能适应延迟和有效压缩带宽。

Conclusion: 引入了语义智能层和语境协议后，月球通信系统可以实现更强大的适应性和决策能力，从而提高整体系统性能。

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its
decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We
propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical deep learning (DL) approach for
energy-efficient traffic classification (TC) on resource-limited
microcontrollers, which are widely used in IoT-based smart systems and
communication networks. Our objective is to balance accuracy, computational
efficiency, and real-world deployability. To that end, we develop a lightweight
1D-CNN, optimized via hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), which
achieves 96.59% accuracy on the ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset with only 88.26K
parameters, a 20.12K maximum tensor size, and 10.08M floating-point operations
(FLOPs). Moreover, it generalizes across various TC tasks, with accuracies
ranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8,
suffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32
counterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two
microcontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive
Nucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and
115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference,
respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of on-device encrypted
traffic analysis, paving the way for scalable, low-power IoT security
solutions.

### [220] [Patient-Specific Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automatic Replanning in Head-and-Neck Cancer Proton Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10073)
*Malvern Madondo,Yuan Shao,Yingzi Liu,Jun Zhou,Xiaofeng Yang,Zhen Tian*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种基于深度强化学习的自动化再规划方法，通过个性化模型提高头颈癌质子治疗计划的质量，显著优于人工方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在头颈癌的强度调制质子治疗过程中，由于解剖结构的变化，会引起布拉格峰的位置移动，导致肿瘤剂量不足和危险器官剂量过高的问题，需要频繁调整治疗计划。然而，目前的手动重新规划过程非常耗费资源和时间。

Method: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的患者特异性框架，用于自动IMPT再规划。该方法通过一个基于150点计划质量评分的奖励机制来解决相互竞争的临床目标，并将规划过程形式化为强化学习问题。使用患者的规划CT和模拟解剖改变（如肿瘤进展和消退）的数据来训练个性化的智能体。使用了两种DRL算法：深度Q网络（DQN）和近端策略优化（PPO），并利用剂量-体积直方图作为状态表示，以及一个22维的优先级调整动作空间。

Result: 在五名头颈癌患者的实际再规划CT数据上进行评估显示，两个DRL智能体均提高了初始计划评分，从初始的120.63 ± 21.40提高到139.78 ± 6.84（DQN）和142.74 ± 5.16（PPO），优于人类规划师产生的手动再规划（137.20 ± 5.58）。临床验证证实这能在多样性的解剖变化情况下实现更好的肿瘤覆盖和保护危险器官。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，深度强化学习在解决自适应质子治疗的几何和剂量学复杂性方面具有潜力，提供了高效的离线适应解决方案并推动在线自适应质子治疗的发展。

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and
organ-at-risk overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual
replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a
patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning
process as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust
optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based
approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using
their planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating
anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific
approach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling
effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network
and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state
representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.
Evaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL
agents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm
6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by
a human planner ($137.20 \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that
improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse
anatomical changes. This work demonstrates DRL's potential in addressing
geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering
efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton
therapy.

Method: 从分布式创造力的视角研究人工智能如何支持创造力。提出三种模式：支持，协同，共生。并从技术自主性和AI系统的代理性两个维度进行分析。

Result: 研究表明，在不同模式下，人工智能可以不同程度地影响从日常问题解决到范式转变的创新水平，揭示了背后的理论、伦理和设计影响。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human
creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of
how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of
distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine
learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations
such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute
sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a
scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome
these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically
generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude
encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands
representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural
Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,
uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights
demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to
quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational
advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum
architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through
extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge
states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating
resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This
research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,
advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional
computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.

Motivation: SSH模型作为一维拓扑绝缘体的典型例子，其在更复杂和现实条件下的行为仍是研究肥沃的地带，因此本文旨在对广义SSH模型进行全面的计算研究。

Method: 本文采用了精确对角化和专用数值求解器，同时运用无监督机器学习（PCA）进行系统相分类，以深入探索广义SSH模型中的拓扑、准周期无序、非厄米性和时间依赖驱动的相互作用。

Result: 研究发现标准SSH模型的拓扑保护边界态被强Aubry-André-Harper调制诱导的局域化转变所破坏。还揭示了强局域化可能掩盖基础的拓扑特征。在非厄米性扩展下，发现了非厄米皮肤效应，表现为所有体态在边界的显著局域化。通过周期性Floquet驱动技术，实现了Floquet拓扑绝缘体，该体系在准能量区域边界出现异常边界态。

Conclusion: 本文通过广泛的计算研究揭示了广义SSH模型中拓扑保护态在强局域化条件下被破坏，并利用机器学习揭示了局域化与拓扑现象的相互掩盖。同时，通过扩展模型的非厄米性和时间依赖驱动，揭示了非厄米皮肤效应和Floquet拓扑绝缘体的工程实现。

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a
one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex,
realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents
a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models,
exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder,
non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and
specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its
spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse
Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model
exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a
localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to
autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization
can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond
Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization
of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to
a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological
insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the
boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a
multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological
systems.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the
formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the
viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit
reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell,
{\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network
interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and
interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised
classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic
environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported
crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the
SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics,
underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport
kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of
the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite
initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our
approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable
parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain
insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in
solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

### [226] [Phase-Space Engineering and Dynamical Long-Range Order in Memcomputing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10149)
*Chesson Sipling,Yuan-Hang Zhang,Massimiliano Di Ventra*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: 研究表明，记忆和超参数对 DMM 的计算效率具有重要影响，适当调整可优化相空间探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索 DMM 的物理参数如何影响其解决组合优化问题的效率和性能。

Method: 通过对原型 DMM 的数值仿真，分析物理参数在相空间工程中的作用。

Result: DMM 在大范围参数下能高效探索相空间，并且当超参数选择不当时，相空间的探索效率会降低，但动态长程有序性（DLRO）仍可持续存在。DLRO 只有在记忆与快速自由度同步演化时才会消失。

Conclusion: 研究表明，DMM 的相空间可通过适当的记忆和超参数进行工程设计，以实现最佳的计算效率。

Abstract: Digital Memcomputing machines (DMMs) are dynamical systems with memory (time
non-locality) that have been designed to solve combinatorial optimization
problems. Their corresponding ordinary differential equations depend on a few
hyper-parameters that define both the system's relevant time scales and its
phase-space geometry. Using numerical simulations on a prototypical DMM, we
analyze the role of these physical parameters in engineering the phase space to
either help or hinder the solution search by DMMs. We find that the DMM
explores its phase space efficiently for a wide range of parameters, aided by
the long-range correlations in their fast degrees of freedom that emerge
dynamically due to coupling with the (slow) memory degrees of freedom. In this
regime, the time it takes for the system to find a solution scales well as the
number of variables increases. When these hyper-parameters are chosen poorly,
the system navigates its phase space far less efficiently. However, we find
that, in many cases, dynamical long-range order (DLRO) persists even when the
phase-space exploration process is inefficient. DLRO only disappears if the
memories are made to evolve as quickly as the fast degrees of freedom. This
study points to the important role of memory and hyper-parameters in
engineering the DMMs' phase space for optimal computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 采用多尺度控制变量和SAPNNs策略，在保持物理一致性的同时提高动能不确定性量化中的抽样效率与精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动力在于解决具有随机参数的动能方程高维性所带来的主要计算挑战，尤其是在不确定性量化（UQ）方面。传统的蒙特卡洛（MC）抽样方法存在收敛慢和方差高的问题，并随着参数空间维度的增加变得愈发严重。

Method: 采用多尺度控制变量策略，通过利用简化动能模型的低保真度解决方案来降低方差。此外，引入基于结构和渐近保持神经网络（SAPNNs）的代理模型，以改善抽样效率并保持潜在的物理性。

Result: 通过在低保真度模型上训练SAPNNs，并用完整的Boltzmann方程的精选高保真度样本丰富这些网络，我们的方案在保持物理一致性和渐近准确性的同时，实现了显著的方差缩减。这一方法在动能UQ中实现了高效的大规模预测，并在均质和非均质多尺度模式下验证了其有效性。数值结果显示，与标准MC技术相比，精度和计算效率均有改善。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在动能不确定性量化中实现了高效的大规模预测，并且在各种多尺度模式下展示了更高的准确性和计算效率。

Abstract: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters poses
major computational challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Traditional
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow
convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the
dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we
adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity
solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve
sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate
models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).
These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical
properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and
asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching
them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our
method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical
consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient
large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous
and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve discriminator performance in scenarios with limited labeled data by utilizing diffusion models.

Method: The method involves convexly mixing scores from different class-conditioned trajectories during diffusion sampling to generate challenging synthetic samples.

Result: ScoreMix improves discriminative capabilities across all studied benchmarks and shows that combining classes distant in embedding space yields better performance.

Conclusion: ScoreMix significantly enhances discriminator performance, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data, by leveraging score compositional properties of diffusion models.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

TL;DR: 引入CIDer框架和随机模态特征缺失任务，以提高多模态情感识别的稳健性，并在OOD场景下表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别在面对模态缺失和分布外数据时存在挑战，现有方法依赖于特定模型或参数过多，限制了其实用性。

Method: 提出了Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer) 框架，包括一个模型特定的自蒸馏模块（MSSD）和一个与模型无关的因果推理模块（MACI）。

Result: 实验证明CIDer在两种场景下实现了稳健的性能，同时参数更少，训练更快。

Conclusion: CIDer在RMFM和OOD场景下表现出色，参数更少，训练更快。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

Motivation: 提高深度学习模型在皮肤癌分类中的性能，特别是在数据稀缺和缺乏不确定性感知时，以改善患者治疗和预后。

Method: 在研究中，首先使用迁移学习对深度学习模型进行基准测试，包括使用预训练的特征提取器和传统分类器的组合。然后，使用不确定性量化技术，包括蒙特卡罗Dropout、集成模型和集成蒙特卡罗Dropout 来评估模型的可靠性。

Result: 结果表明，LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 和支持向量机器（SVM）的组合具有最高的分类性能。集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理之间提供了良好的平衡，而集成蒙特卡罗 Dropout 在面临不确定预测时更为敏感。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，将不确定性量化（UQ）纳入深度学习（DL）模型中，是提高皮肤癌分类可靠性和准确性的有效方法，尤其是在真实临床应用中。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

Method: 引入VideoDeepResearch框架，该框架结合了文本推理模型和模块化多模态工具包，通过推理制定问题解决策略，并通过工具有选择地访问和利用视频内容。

Result: 实验表明，VideoDeepResearch在流行的LVU基准上取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: VideoDeepResearch显著提升了LVU任务的性能，相比现有的MLLM基线，在MLVU、LVBench和LongVideoBench上分别提高了9.6%、6.6%和3.9%。

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic

Conclusion: 提出弱监督多模态框架生成SOAP笔记，减少对人工注释的依赖，减轻临床医生的工作负担。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型（VLMs）在在线学习环境中通过面部表情分析学生学术情感的潜力，从而克服传统机器学习模型跨情境泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 本文采用Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct和Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct两个VLM模型，使用零样本提示对5,000张图像进行分析，这些图像描绘了困惑、分心、快乐、中立和疲惫的表情。

Conclusion: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct在识别学生的困惑表情方面表现优异，展示了其在识别导致学生困惑的内容方面的实践应用潜力。

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

Conclusion: 该方法具有量化和解释城市风格演变的潜力，为未来设计提供了科学基础。

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

TL;DR: 文章引入了一项新任务：知识图像生成，提出MMMG基准用于评估模型的推理能力，并揭示了现有模型的推理缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索图像生成模型的推理能力，以应对生成知识图像的挑战。

Method: 提出了MMMG基准和FLUX-Reason模型，并使用MMMG-Score进行评估。

Result: 测试揭示了现有模型的严重推理缺陷，FLUX-Reason作为基线模型也仅获得34.45的MMMG-Score。

Conclusion: 现有的图像生成模型在知识图像生成任务中表现不佳，存在严重的推理缺陷。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pisces, a novel multimodal foundation model, uses a decoupled architecture and specialized training to excel in image understanding and generation, reducing the performance gap with specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the performance gap between unified multimodal models and specialized models by overcoming the inherent differences in visual features and training processes required for image understanding and generation.

Method: Pisces utilizes a decoupled visual encoding architecture along with tailored training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. The development process also included meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning.

Result: Pisces achieved competitive performance in both image understanding, evidenced by evaluations on over 20 public benchmarks, and in image generation, as demonstrated on the GenEval benchmark.

Conclusion: Pisces demonstrated strong performance in both image understanding and generation through its novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

Motivation: 研究探讨不同权重初始化方法对训练模型的量化鲁棒性影响的初始条件改进。

Method: 使用图超网络（GHN）预测量化DNN的参数，并通过细调GHN以预测量化图的参数（称为GHN-QAT）。

Result: GHN-QAT方法能显著提高量化CNN的准确性，尤其是在4位和2位量化下。

Conclusion: GHN-QAT显著提高了4位量化的准确性，并在2位量化中表现出超过随机初始化的准确性。这是首次对量化感知的DNN权重初始化进行深入研究。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

*Shuyang Li,Shuang Wang,Zhuangzhuang Sun,Jing Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed PSLG-SAM framework improves remote sensing image segmentation by decomposing tasks into localization and segmentation, reducing annotation needs and enhancing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in current RRSIS methods such as dense annotation requirements and complex scene interpretation.

Method: PSLG-SAM framework decomposes RRSIS into two stages: coarse localization with a visual grounding network and fine segmentation using SAM with a clustering-based foreground point generator and mask boundary iterative optimization.

Result: PSLG-SAM achieves superior performance on RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M datasets and reduces annotation data burden.

Conclusion: PSLG-SAM achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art models in remote sensing image segmentation.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 目前视觉语言模型在视觉认知方面的强化学习效果有限，主要原因在于缺乏同时具有挑战性和明确可验证的视觉任务。因此研究引入了一种新的视觉任务来解决这一问题。

Method: 引入ViCrit（视觉字幕幻觉评审）任务，作为强化学习代理任务，以培训视觉语言模型定位注入到人类撰写的图像说明段落中的细微、合成的视觉幻觉。并通过ViCrit-Bench基准测试进行系统评估。

Result: 使用ViCrit任务训练的模型在各种视觉语言基准测评中显示出显著提升，这些改进不仅限于自然图片训练数据，还可推广到抽象图像推理和视觉数学领域。

Conclusion: 细粒度的幻觉批判是增强视觉语言模型中视觉感知的有效且可推广的目标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视频大型语言模型(Vid-LLMs)在多模态理解方面有所进展，但在流媒体视频推理中依然存在挑战，主要由于其依赖背景信息。现有范式将所有可用的历史背景信息输入Vid-LLMs，导致视觉数据处理的计算负担显著。此外，包含不相关背景会使模型偏离关键细节。

Method: 引入了一项名为'Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning(CogStream)'的任务，模拟现实世界的流媒体视频场景，要求模型识别最相关的历史背景信息，以推导针对当前流的问题的答案。为支持CogStream，我们提供了一个密集注释的数据集，具有广泛和分层的问题答案对，由半自动管道生成。此外，提出了CogReasoner作为基准模型。该模型通过视觉流压缩和历史对话检索有效地解决这一任务。

Result: 广泛的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CogStream任务及CogReasoner基准模型有效解决了在流媒体视频推理中选择相关背景信息的挑战，有助于提升多模态理解。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

Abstract: Explaining why the species lives at a particular location is important for
understanding ecological systems and conserving biodiversity. However, existing
ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists.
We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species
image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The
system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval,
pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal
structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,
showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended
ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in
human-understandable language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别系统存在人口统计偏差，尤其在评分分布的尾部部分，很难被现有指标检测到，因此需要新的指标来解决这个问题。

Method: 提出了综合公平指数（CEI），单独分析真实和伪造者的得分分布，聚焦于尾部概率，同时考虑整体分布形状，并通过自动版CEI^A提高客观性和应用的便利性。

Result: 实验表明CEI指标在检测微妙的偏差方面优于之前的方法，并能在实际中简化公平性评估。

Conclusion: CEI是一个用于操作人脸识别公平性评估的强大且敏感的工具，所提出的方法不仅适用于面部识别中的偏差评估，也适用于任何需要分析分布尾部的统计分布比较问题。

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在电子商务和数字营销中，生成高保真的人物产品演示视频对于产品有效展示非常重要。然而，大部分现有框架要么无法保留人物和产品的身份特征，要么缺乏对人物与产品之间空间关系的理解，导致不现实的表现和不自然的互动。

Method: 我们提出了基于Diffusion Transformer (DiT) 的框架。通过注入配对的人人物-产品参考信息并利用附加的掩码交叉注意力机制，我们的方法同时保留人物身份和产品特定细节，例如标识和纹理。我们使用3D身体网格模板和产品边界框提供精确的动作指导，支持手势与产品位置的直观对齐。此外，采用结构化文本编码融入类别级语义，增强帧之间小幅旋转变化时的3D一致性。

Result: 在采用广泛的数据增强策略训练的混合数据集上，我们的方法在保持人物和产品身份完整性和生成逼真演示动作方面优于先进技术。

Conclusion: 通过提出基于Diffusion Transformer的新方法，解决了现有框架在人物和产品身份保留和空间关系理解方面的不足，能够生成更现实和自然的人物产品演示视频。

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

Motivation: 现有的文本生成纹理方法会导致视点之间纹理属性的逐渐变化，限制了纹理信息的有效使用，最终影响纹理的一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明TexTailor在合成视图一致性纹理方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TexTailor在生成一致性对象纹理方面优于当前的最先进的方法。

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

Motivation: Flow Matching框架在学习分布之间连续转换方面表现出色，促进了高保真生成建模。该研究旨在通过统一语义分割、分类和图像生成任务来拓展Flow Matching的应用。

Method: 引入了一种对称学习目标，并提出新的训练目标，以显式保留语义信息，能够在不经过反复优化的情况下进行图像分割和分类。

Result: 在多个基准测试上，SymmFlow在语义图像合成上取得了领先性能，使用CelebAMask-HQ数据集获得FID得分为11.9，使用COCO-Stuff数据集在仅25次推理步骤内获得FID得分为7.0。同时在语义分割和分类任务上也呈现良好的结果。

Conclusion: Symmetrical Flow Matching提供了一种统一的模型框架，以双向的一致性处理并保留足够熵来实现生成多样性，同时支持灵活的条件化。

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly

Motivation: 现有原型方法的图像空间可视化与人类可理解的生物标记不一致，且在医学成像中的可解释性较弱，难以有效表现生物标记和病变的影响。

Method: 提出了PiPViT（一种基于视觉转换器的可解释原型模型），通过对比学习和多分辨率输入处理，提高了生物标记跨尺度的定位效果。

Result: 在四个数据集上进行的视网膜OCT图像分类实验中，PiPViT获得了与最先进方法竞争的定量性能，同时提供了更有意义的说明。测试集上的定量评估证实了学习到的原型在语义和临床上是相关的。

Conclusion: PiPViT可以透明地解释其决策，并协助临床医生理解诊断结果。

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Conclusion: HyperCLIC在识别对象的多种粒度和提高层次概括性表现上有效。

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在深度学习中取得了巨大的成功，但其原理尚缺乏理论支撑，需要更深入的解释。

Method: 开发一个统一的图像处理框架，用于解释自注意力机制及其组件，并进行架构上的改进。

Result: 图像处理启发的变动不仅提升了模型的可解释性，还提高了准确性和对抗性稳健性。

Conclusion: 引入基于图像处理的框架后，改进了对自注意力机制的理解，同时提高了模型的性能。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

TL;DR: 提出SbCA模型，通过笔画向量放大和细节补全实现超大尺度图像放大，解决了现有方法的模糊问题，显著提高视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的任意尺度图像超分辨方法在放大因子超过训练数据的范围时，表现会显著下降，并引入模糊。因此，提出一种统一模型用于超大放大任务，称为基于笔画的循环放大器（SbCA）。

Method: 提出了笔画向量放大器，将图像分解为表示为矢量图形的连续笔画进行放大，并通过细节补全模块恢复缺失细节，实现高保真图像重建。通过循环策略反复细化细节，SbCA模型仅需一次训练即可应用于各种尺度内，并保持子尺度在训练范围内。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法在超大放大任务上（如$	imes100$）显著优于现有方法，视觉质量远超当前最先进技术。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了分布漂移问题，消除了伪影、噪声和模糊，生成高质量的高分辨率超分辨图像。

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的以物体为中心的动态模拟方法虽然取得了一定进展，但忽略了物理知识的整合以及模型在多种情形下的适应能力。研究旨在填补这些空缺。

Method: SlotPi与Hamiltonian原理基础上的物理模块结合，并通过时空预测模块进行动态预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，SlotPi模型在预测任务和视觉问答任务上表现优异。研究团队也创建了一个涵盖物体交互、流体动态以及流体-物体交互的真实世界数据集，以验证模型的能力。

Conclusion: SlotPi模型在不同数据集上表现出色，证明其在复杂物体交互和流体动态场景中的适应能力。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频抠图在计算上密集，对资源受限设备部署存在挑战，需要模型压缩和加速技术，而后训练量化技术在保持准确性和时间一致性上面临重大障碍。

Method: 本文提出了一个两阶段的PTQ策略，以及一个统计驱动的全局仿射校准（GAC）方法和一个光流辅助（OFA）组件。

Result: PTQ4VM方法在准确性上达到了最先进的性能，特别是在4位量化时表现接近全精度，同时节省了8倍的FLOP。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的用于视频抠图模型的后训练量化（PTQ）框架，克服了在准确性和时间一致性方面的挑战。这一框架能够在不同位宽下达到现有量化方法中的最先进性能，甚至在4位量化时接近全精度性能，同时实现8倍的FLOP节省。

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Motivation: 现有的评价缺乏对时间推理和程序有效性的考量，因此需要一个新的基准来评估大模型的多步推理能力。

Method: VRBench设计了一个多阶段评估流程，评估模型在结果和过程层面的表现。除了使用MCQ评估最终结果外，还提出了一种进度级别的LLM引导评分指标，以多维度综合评估推理链的质量。

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that

Motivation: 现有的ZSGM方法假设图像偏移和文本偏移在CLIP嵌入空间中完全对齐，导致生成图像质量下降。研究受NLP中偏移错位研究的启发。

Method: 提出了适应性迭代改进(AIR)的方法，针对现有方法的限制研究了CLIP嵌入空间中的偏移错位现象。

Result: 发现CLIP嵌入空间中的偏移错位与概念距离相关，提出的AIR方法改善了目标域图像质量。

Conclusion: 提出的AIR方法能够改善目标域图像质量，在多项测试中展现出SOTA性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

Motivation: 现有的Transformer模型在时空建模上计算成本过高，限制了实际应用，而线性时间序列建模的进步提供了一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用多模态扩散Mamba块（MM-DiM块）进行多模态信息和时空建模，通过多模态令牌重新组合设计来实现。

Result: M4V在降低计算成本方面取得了显著效果，生成的视频质量高，并且Mamba块在生成768x1280分辨率视频时，比基于Attention的方法减少了45%的FLOPs。

Conclusion: M4V能够在降低计算成本的同时生成高质量视频，提供了一种高效的文本到视频生成解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉自动回归生成模型的可扩展性和与其他模态的兼容性优于扩散模型，但现有方法的图像补丁固有并行性与自动回归建模的因果性相悖。

Method: SpectralAR通过光谱视角进行因果性视觉序列生成。具体步骤包括：首先使用嵌套谱令牌化将图像转换为有序谱令牌，表示从低到高频率的组件；然后以粗到细的方式进行自回归生成。

Result: SpectralAR在ImageNet-1K上进行的广泛实验中，实现了3.02 gFID，仅使用了64个令牌和310M参数。

Conclusion: SpectralAR实现了视觉序列的因果性和令牌效率，无需复杂设计，在图像重建性能上表现出色。

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

Result: CDPruner在多种MLLMs上实验显示能够高效修剪视觉令牌，显著降低FLOPs和CUDA延迟，同时维持接近原始的精度。

Conclusion: CDPruner在各种视觉语言基准测试中建立了新的性能标准，实现了高效的视觉令牌修剪。

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

Conclusion: 本文首次提供了扩散模型中注意力扰动的头级分析，揭示了注意力层内可解释的专门化，并支持有效扰动策略的实际设计。

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences
strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces
practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must
be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR
device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed
and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and
worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic
Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service
(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic
transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By
deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key
semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut
latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel
interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction
rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the
SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image
quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

Motivation: 当前处理交通事故预判的方法通常将其视为需要进行事故发生时长繁重标注的监督学习任务。然而，交通场景的固有长尾、不确定性和快速演变特性使得真正的事故因果部分难以识别，数据偏差很容易导致背景混杂问题。

Method: 我们提出了一种名为注意视频扩散（AVD）的模型，通过生成仪表盘摄像头视频中的因果部分（即从正常片段到事故片段）来合成附加的事故视频剪辑，以进行交通事故预判。

Result: 我们的注意视频扩散（AVD）模型以及等变TAA（EQ-TAA）方法经过广泛实验，展示了与当前最先进方法的竞争性能。

Conclusion: 我们提出的AVD模型可以通过合成附加的事故视频剪辑，有效地为交通事故预判问题提供解决方案，并且在实验中表现出与当前最先进方法有竞争力的性能。

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

### [267] [HER2 Expression Prediction with Flexible Multi-Modal Inputs via Dynamic Bidirectional Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10006)
*Jie Qin,Wei Yang,Yan Su,Yiran Zhu,Weizhen Li,Yunyue Pan,Chengchang Pan,Honggang Qi*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个适应性双模态框架，通过动态分支选择、双向跨模态GAN和混合训练提升HER2预测准确性，并降低IHC成本，适用于不同医疗环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的HER2评估模型单独分析H&E或IHC图像，而临床上依赖它们的综合解释，但同步获取这两种模态常因工作流程复杂性和成本限制而受阻。因而，提出一个灵活的HER2单/双模态预测框架，以提高预测性能并降低成本。

Method: 该研究提出了一种适应性双模态框架，包括三个创新：1）动态分支选择器，根据输入的完整性激活单一模态重构或双模态联合推理；2）双向跨模态GAN，在上下文感知的特征空间中对缺失模态进行重构；3）结合对抗学习和多任务优化的混合训练协议。

Result: 该框架将单模态H&E的预测准确率从71.44%提高到94.25%，双模态准确率达到95.09%，单独IHC输入时仍能保持90.28%的可靠性。实验验证显示，相比H&E/IHC基线分别提升了22.81%/12.90%的准确率，同时通过跨模态重构增强了F1-score（HE到IHC）和（IHC到HE）。该系统减少了78.55%的参数量，保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的HER2双模态预测框架，通过动态分支选择、双向跨模态GAN和混合训练协议，提高了单模态和双模态HER2的预测精度，且在资源有限的环境中能够通过减少IHC的基础设施成本实现近似双模态的性能。

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

TL;DR: 本文通过多模态情感绑定和注意力引导的潜在扩散模型提升音频驱动3D面部动画的情感控制和表现力，实验结果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动的情感3D面部动画面临两个主要挑战：对单一模态控制信号的依赖，以及确定性回归映射限制了情感表达的随机性和非语言行为，抑制合成动画的表现力。

Method: 本文的方法包括两大创新：（1）通过对比学习的FLAME中心多模态情感绑定策略，使文本、音频和情感标签等多种模态对齐，实现从多个信号源进行灵活情感控制。（2）基于注意力的潜在扩散模型，该模型具有内容感知注意力和情感引导层，能够丰富动作多样性，同时保持时间一致性和自然面部动态。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，我们的方法在大多数指标上优于现有方法，在情感相似性上提高了21.6%，同时保留了生理合理的面部动态。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于扩散的框架来生成可控的富有表现力的3D面部动画，通过多模态情感绑定策略和注意力引导的潜在扩散模型，提高了动画的情感控制能力和表现力。

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

Motivation: 为了在视觉叙事中实现结构化理解，尤其是多模态媒体如漫画，该研究提出构建层次化知识图谱框架。

Method: 该方法将叙事内容分解为多个层次，通过综合知识图谱表示语义、空间和时间关系，特别是在面板层级构建多模态图谱，链接视觉元素与文本组件，并在各叙事层面上进行整合。

Result: 应用于Manga109数据集的手工注释子集，展示了框架在各种叙事任务中的高效性与解释能力，提高了任务的准确率和召回率。

Conclusion: 本文提出的层次化知识图谱框架能够有效支持多种叙事任务的符号推理，展示了较高的准确率和召回率，验证了框架的连贯性和可解释性。

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法常常忽视了非语言线索中丰富的语义内容，而主要关注文本分析，因此需要一种能够有效整合视频、音频和文本信息的框架。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的基于小波驱动的多模态意图识别框架，包括小波驱动的融合模块和跨模态交互机制，以增强非语言信息的频域分析与语义融合。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在MIntRec上的表现优于之前的方法，准确率提高了1.13%，并且消融实验验证了小波驱动的融合模块能够增加识别精度。

Conclusion: 通过频域分析非语言信息，本研究提出的WDMIR框架能够增强对用户意图的理解，实现了先进的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal
systems.

### [272] [Multimodal Emotion Coupling via Speech-to-Facial and Bodily Gestures in Dyadic Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10010)
*Von Ralph Dane Marquez Herbuela,Yukie Nagai*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本研究发现，在推动情感表达的语音、面部和手部动态一致性中，非重叠语音最能激发下脸部和口腔活动，悲伤与非重叠语音有关，重叠语音中愤怒抑制手势，低唤醒和重叠语音增强手语同步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语音与面部和手部动态之间的广泛联系对于深入了解情感和行为线索在真实互动中的传递至关重要，尤其是进一步调节语音同步的对话交换结构，如顺序轮流，会对实时情感检测的准确性产生影响。

Method: 使用IEMOCAP语料库中的双人互动的特定区域运动捕捉，通过框架位移幅度量化表达的活跃度，并通过语音到手势预测，将语音特征映射到面部和手部的动作。

Result: 非重叠的言语一致地激发了更大的活跃性，尤其是在下脸部和口腔部位。通过预测映射发现，在发音区域的声学特征如基频和MFCC方面预测准确度最高，而唤醒和效价的相关性更低且更具情境敏感性。其中，低唤醒和重叠语音环境下的手与语音同步性更强，而效价不会受到这样的增强。

Conclusion: 在情绪表达中，非重叠的言语更能激发下脸部和口腔部位的活动性，悲伤情绪在非重叠语境中表现出更高的表现力，而愤怒情绪在重叠语境中会抑制手势。语音与手势的同步在低唤醒和重叠语境中得到增强。

Abstract: Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and
gestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader
dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand
motion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and
behavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the
coordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn
taking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and
simultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this
alignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances
realtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony
across modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study
examines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from
dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level
prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions
(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker
displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise
displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech
features to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently
elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness
showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed
gestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for
prosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower
and more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was
enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.

Motivation: 传统的向量内积要求因子向量具有相同的维度，而半张量积（STP）推广了这一概念，使得不同维度的向量也可以进行内积。然而，传统卷积运算中常用的填充方法可能会引入冗余信息。在此背景下，本文提出了一种基于域的卷积乘积（CP)，并结合半张量积提出新型卷积乘积，以避免填充引入的无用信息。

there is no zero or any other padding, it can avoid the junk information caused
by padding. Using it, the STP-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is
developed. Its application to image and third order signal identifications is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性流动控制策略在强干扰序列中可能失效，但其仍具有发展更好策略的潜力。研究目的是通过改进的方法来提高强干扰序列中的升力调节能力。

Method: 本文采用了一种基于变换器的强化学习框架，通过变光控制学习有效策略来调节升力。为了加速训练，采用了两种技术：专家策略的预训练（线性控制）和任务层面的迁移学习（从单独的阵风过渡到多阵风）。

Result: 学习到的策略在调节升力方面优于最佳比例控制，尤其在阵风数增加时表现尤为显著。实验显示，学习到的策略在较少阵风环境下能有效推广至任意长度的阵风序列环境中。

Conclusion: 通过四分之一弦片的变光控制能显著减少控制努力，同时实现卓越的升力调节。研究成功展示了所提出的基于变换器的强化学习框架在多种配置下的可推广性，结合加速技术，提供了解决更复杂流动控制问题的有前途的方法。

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain
effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions,
but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the
present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic
lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the
challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We
demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --
pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level
transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to
multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best
proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts
increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number
of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with
an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration
and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift
regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord
pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this
advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord
pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of
the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach
to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined
with the proposed acceleration techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算流体力学方法解释性强、收敛性好，但计算代价高昂。解算器加速的AI方法存在模型不稳定、数据需求大等问题。需要一种在有限数据甚至无监督情况下，能够快速推断且准确预测的解决方案。

Conclusion: OmniFluids在流场重建和湍流统计方面显著优于现有的AI驱动方法，实现了比传统求解器快10-100倍的速度，同时能够从稀疏、噪声数据中准确恢复未知物理参数。

Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in
various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational
fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed
convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques.
However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely
data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware
methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss
functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing
coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce
OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that
integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and
few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction
under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key
components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder,
and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of
diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with
physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional
benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven
methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy,
delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately
recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work
establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling
in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

Motivation: 解决在形式化过程中使用de Bruijn索引引发的挑战，并证明在这个设置下bisimulation是一个全同且早期、后期和开放的仿真。

Method: 通过非形式化的手工方式证明了健全性和完整性，以及所有必需的引理。编码专门化为内部pi-calculus以避开使用de Bruijn索引的某些挑战。

Result: 证明了编码满足Gorla提出的良好编码标准，并展示了与Milner编码的相似性。开始用Coq形式化证明pi-i-calculus中编码的健全性和完整性。

Conclusion: 该论文证明了将Levy的call-by-push-value lambda-calculus编码至pi-calculus的方法是既健全又完整的。

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

TL;DR: StepProof, a new method for step-by-step verification in autoformalization, shows improved proof success and efficiency over traditional methods by enabling sentence-level verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome current limitations of autoformalization tools which verify only complete proofs and lack sentence-level verification capabilities.

Method: The method proposed is StepProof, a novel autoformalization method designed for step-by-step verification, breaking down proofs into verifiable subproofs for sentence-level verification.

Result: Experimental results show StepProof enhances proof success rates and efficiency, with minor manual adjustments further boosting performance.

Conclusion: StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency in autoformalization compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal
verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their
lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of
natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of
translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified.
Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited
to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level
verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel
autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification.
StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs,
enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that
StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to
the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification,
further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

Abstract: Robotics and artificial intelligence hold significant potential for advancing
precision agriculture. While robotic systems have been successfully deployed
for various tasks, adapting them to perform diverse missions remains
challenging, particularly because end users often lack technical expertise. In
this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language
models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data
collection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To
enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task
specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge
high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive
experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this
context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing
challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering
farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these
technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce
additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly
challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with
existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic
mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots
through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language
into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

Conclusion: 尽管在严格评估设置下，将通用化到未见过的环境中存在挑战，但这种模块化方法为可扩展和高效的导航系统奠定了基础，强调了通过增强环境先验知识和扩展多模态输入集成未来改进的有希望方向。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded
in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and
road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in
a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology
prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our
method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their
association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to
comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and
conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian Mixture Copula Models for modeling driving scenarios, showing improved fit against previous models, suggesting its potential as a standard for safety validation in automated driving systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and flexibility of modeling driving scenarios for automated driving safety assessments by using Gaussian Mixture Copula Models.

Method: Applied Gaussian Mixture Copula Models to statistical modeling of driving scenarios, and benchmarked against previous models using real-world driving data.

Result: Gaussian Mixture Copula Models provided a better fit to real-world driving data in terms of likelihood and Sinkhorn distance compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: Gaussian Mixture Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation frameworks.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

Motivation: 解决现有视图-语言导航（VLN）中无法泛化到分布外环境和对固定离散动作空间的依赖，特别针对无人机在复杂环境中依语言指示飞行的需求。

Method: VLFly框架集成了三个模块：基于大型语言模型的指令编码器、由视觉语言模型驱动的目标检索器以及生成可执行轨迹的航点规划器。在没有局部化或主动测距传感器的条件下，VLFly通过载机单目相机捕获的自我中心观察输出连续速度命令。

Conclusion: VLFly在多样的模拟环境中优于所有基线，并且在真实世界的室内和室外导航任务中表现出色，能够理解开放词汇的目标和实现广义导航能力，即使在抽象语言输入的情况下。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

Motivation: 为在某些尺度上更深刻地理解机器人运动与颗粒地形的相互作用，提出并应用了一种替代性的数据驱动建模方法。

Method: 该方法结合了维度缩减技术（顺序截断高阶奇异值分解）、代理建模（高斯过程）和数据同化技术（降阶粒子滤波），并可在线使用，基于从离线高保真仿真数据集合和稀疏实验数据集合中获取的离线数据。

Result: 所提数据驱动建模方法较物理基础高保真模拟大幅减少了计算时间，并且在同时使用模拟数据和稀疏的实际测量数据时，在长周期预测上表现出潜力。此外，该方法还能再现物理基础模拟的最大抗力缩放关系，表明其预测能力可能超出个案分析。

Conclusion: 该数据驱动建模方法在与物理基础高保真模拟相当的准确性上，大大减少了计算时间，并且在长周期预测时可能超过仅靠高保真模拟的性能。

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

Motivation: 研究者希望通过减少模型收敛时间和计算资源，实现更高效的全球海洋生态系统模型稳态预测。

Method: 本文使用了条件变分自编码器（CVAE）并结合质量修正来构建从生物地球化学模型参数到三维平衡稳态年周期的映射。

Result: 与使用均值作为初值相比，CVAE的预测显著加速了模型的自旋过程，可减少50%到95%的迭代次数，从而大幅降低计算时间需求。

Conclusion: 使用CVAE的预测可以有效提高全球海洋生态系统模型的稳态估计，且在实现计算资源节约方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: We used precomputed steady states obtained by a spin-up for a global marine
ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping from the small number of
biogeochemical model parameters onto the three-dimensional converged steady
annual cycle. The mapping was performed by a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that
the prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good
approximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the
predictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained
in the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values
for a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,
corresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the
spin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally
uniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied
stopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in
needed iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to
95\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these
results with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We
found that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.

Result: 该方法应用于2021年太平洋西北地区热浪，产生的气温异常比75成员集合中最极端的气温高出最多3.7摄氏度，这些轨迹表现了大气阻塞和罗斯贝波模式的增强。

Conclusion: 微分气候模型可以有效探索事件可能性的上限，为构建极端天气情景提供了一种有力的新方法。

Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is
essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on
large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or
lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we
present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model,
NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent
worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest
heatwave, our method produces temperature anomalies up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above
the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature
intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns--hallmarks
of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate
models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing
a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather
under climate change.

TL;DR: 研究提出FastFLUX，通过架构剪枝和局部微调提高推理效率，保持高图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模参数模型导致慢推理和高内存使用，使得这些模型部署性差。现有加速方法性能下降明显，训练成本高。

Method: 提出了一种名为FastFLUX的架构级剪枝框架，核心是使用BRLL方法和三明治训练策略，通过取代复杂结构的残差分支和局部微调，提高推理效率。

Result: FastFLUX在保留高图像质量的同时，显著提高了推理速度，即使在剔除20%的层次结构后也是如此。

Conclusion: FastFLUX有效解决了推理速度慢和部署性差的问题，保持了高质量的图像生成效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

Method: 提出了Ambient Diffusion Omni框架，该框架利用自然图像的两种特性——谱幂律衰变和局部性，允许在训练期间从所有可用图像中提取信号。

Result: 通过使用合成的高斯模糊、JPEG压缩和运动模糊的图像进行验证，该框架实现了在ImageNet上的最新最优FID。此外，在文本到图像生成建模中，图像质量和多样性均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过利用低质量、合成和分布外的图像，可以提高扩散模型的质量。

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

Conclusion: 提出的学习型密度均衡映射框架（LDEM）在增强密度均衡性和保持双射性方面表现优于传统方法，并且能够在不改变模型架构的情况下，轻松从2D拓展到3D。

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

Result: 实验表明，RAAI能有效地破解LLM，使有害响应率从2.15%提升至61.04%，并且用RAAI生成的合成数据微调LLM可以在提高模型对抗有害提示的鲁棒性同时，保持其在标准任务上的一般能力。

Conclusion: RAAI可以作为可扩展和可控的安全对齐工具，利用生成的合成数据提高模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

*Haoyang Li,Huan Gao,Zhiyuan Zhao,Zhiyu Lin,Junyu Gao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MalwareBench is introduced to test LLMs' security in code generation, revealing vulnerabilities with an average rejection rate dropping from 60.93% to 39.92% with jailbreak methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the specific vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks in code generation, as this area has not been thoroughly investigated.

Method: The study introduces MalwareBench, a benchmark dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts used to test LLM robustness against malicious code generation. Experiments measured rejection rates of malicious content under various scenarios.

Result: Experiments reveal that mainstream LLMs have a 60.93% average rejection rate for malicious content, which decreases to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak attack strategies.

Conclusion: LLMs have limited ability to reject malicious code-generation requirements, and their security is further compromised when various jailbreak methods are combined.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened
concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak
attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While
prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs,
their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains
largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark
dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation,
designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based
on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11
jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that
mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation
requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces
the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for
malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak
attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of
LLMs still pose significant challenges.

TL;DR: PME turns LLMs' memorization from a limitation into a privacy defense, reducing PII leakage and maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs might store Personally Identifiable Information among large amounts of uncontrolled data, which should not be leaked. PME aims to convert the memorization ability of LLMs into a privacy defense strategy.

Method: Detect memorized PII and edit the model's knowledge of its training data to mitigate this memorization without affecting the language model's performance.

Result: The PME approach successfully mitigates PII memorization, maintaining the model's performance while enhancing robustness against privacy attacks.

Conclusion: PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in numerous configurations, and in some cases, it can even reduce the accuracy of privacy attacks to zero.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

*Tianyu Chen,Jian Lou,Wenjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AQUA是首个用于多模态RAG系统中图像知识保护的水印框架，通过嵌入语义信号，有效保护图像版权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG发展为服务导向平台，共享知识库的数据版权保护变得至关重要。现有的RAG水印方法仅关注文本知识，图像知识仍未被保护。因此，提出新的方法来保护多模态RAG系统中的图像知识版权是非常重要的。

Method: AQUA通过两种互补的方法将语义信号嵌入到合成图像中：基于首字母缩略词的触发器和空间关系提示。这些技术确保水印信号在经过图像检索器到文本生成器的间接传递后仍然存在，并且高效、有效且不可感知。

Result: 实验结果显示：在各种模型和数据集上的实验表明，AQUA能够实现鲁棒、隐秘和可靠的版权追踪。

Conclusion: AQUA提供了一个有效的方法来保护多模态RAG系统中图像知识的版权。实验结果表明，它具有鲁棒、隐秘和可靠的特性，可以弥补当前多模态RAG保护中的关键缺口。

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented
platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the
copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods
in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected.
In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image
knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals
into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers
and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals
survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual
generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across
diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and
reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

TL;DR: GenBreak框架通过微调大语言模型有效探索文本到图像生成器的漏洞，揭示其安全弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管有内容审核系统，但T2I模型仍存在被利用以生成有害内容的风险，而且现有的对抗攻击研究在有效性和规避安全机制上存在局限，缺乏可靠的评估工具。为了弥补这一缺口，提出GenBreak框架来全面探索T2I生成器中的潜在漏洞。

Method: GenBreak框架结合了对经过挑选的数据集进行监督微调以及通过与替代T2I模型的交互进行的强化学习。通过整合多种奖赏信号，来引导LLM设计出能够提升规避能力和图像毒性的对抗性提示，同时保持语义的连贯性和多样性。

Result: 开发的对抗性提示在对商业T2I生成器的黑箱攻击中展示了强大的效果，并揭示了现实且令人担忧的安全性弱点。

Conclusion: GenBreak框架通过对红队大语言模型(LLM)的微调，能够有效探索文本到图像生成器中的潜在漏洞，并揭示商业T2I生成器在安全性上的严重缺陷。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型代理在处理敏感数据时可能出现的未授权泄露问题。

Method: 提出了一个名为 Conversational Manipulation for Privacy Leakage (CMPL) 的审核框架，这是一种迭代探测策略，旨在对执行严格隐私指令的代理进行压力测试。

Result: 在不同领域、数据模式和安全配置下的评估表明，该审核框架能够揭示隐私风险。

Conclusion: CMPL 框架能够揭示现有单回合防御无法阻止的隐私风险。

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是为了评估机器学习模型中机器遗忘方法的有效性，以及面对简单的提示攻击时是否会失败。

Method: 对三类模型家族中的八种遗忘技术进行系统评估，采用基于输出、基于logit、和probe分析的方法来评估遗忘知识的检索程度。

Result: 研究发现，RMU和TAR等方法表现出稳健的遗忘效果，而ELM在特定提示攻击下仍易受攻击，且未学习模型通常不会通过改变答案格式来隐藏知识。

Conclusion: 结果挑战了当前关于遗忘有效性的假设，强调需要可靠的评估框架以区分真正的知识移除和表面的输出抑制，并公开了相应评估框架。

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

Result: SOFT在多个领域和不同规模的LLM架构上有效减少了隐私风险，并保持了模型性能。

Conclusion: SOFT成功在有效减少隐私风险的同时，保持了竞争的模型性能，是一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，用于保护微调LLMs中的敏感信息。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely
adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often
involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns.
In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the
vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during
fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information.
These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT
(\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM
\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates
privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable
parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive
experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales.
Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining
competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to
safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

Conclusion: 定义的多智能体LLM系统可以显著提升在特定应用中的潜力和适用性，并允许对LLM、推理技术及相关方面进行系统评估。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g.,
through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For
applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based
multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining
reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications
might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents.
However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques,
and applications individually, their joint specification and combined
application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM
systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for
specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning
techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory
research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system.
The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a
specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving
cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation
approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering,
server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by
agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their
deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak
attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense
mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a
promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is
fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework.
In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic
analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel,
multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key
dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to
assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and
experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail
approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide
insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured
foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled
advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. The code is available at

Result: TED-LaST在多个数据集和模型架构上有效抵御复杂的后门攻击。

Conclusion: TED-LaST显著提高了深度神经网络中对抗复杂的后门攻击的能力，成为了增强网络安全的新标杆。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model
behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be
vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological
representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,
we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow
release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that
enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key
innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.
These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade
traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological
space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data
poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced
adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious
tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST
effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,
and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for
robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against
evolving threats.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SilentBadDiffusion（SBD）方法在图像-文本任务中的攻击性能有限，特别是当可用的毒化样本相对较少时状况不好。由于现有的数据资源受限且并不都适合攻击，研究者需要更好的数据集和方法来实现攻击。

Method: 本文提出一种基于SBD的多元素（ME）攻击方法，通过增加每个被毒化样本的有毒视觉-文本元素数量来增强攻击能力，并引入离散余弦变换（DCT）来保持隐蔽性。

Result: 在两个新的数据集上，所提出的方法在版权侵权率（CIR）和首次攻击时期（FAE）上分别为16.78% / 39.50和51.20% / 23.60，甚至优于Pokemon和Mijourney基准数据集。在低子采样率（5%，6个毒化样本）的条件下，MESI和DCT实现的CIR / FAE分别为0.23% / 84.00和12.73% / 65.50，均优于原始SBD。

Conclusion: 本文提出了新的数据集和基于SBD的多元素攻击方法，改善了攻击性能，使得在低子采样率下也能实现有效的攻击。

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion
(SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to
launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text
pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew
outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the
feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even
constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or
inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are
suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning
samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets
accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME)
attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text
elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while
importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain
the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch
(FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60,
respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney
datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI
and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than
original SBD, which failed to attack at all.

Motivation: 针对Tree-Ring，这一在高不可感知性和抗删除攻击方面表现优异的扩散模型水印技术，寻找新的攻击方法。

Method: 本研究通过利用可变自编码器来逼近模型的中间潜在空间，从而进行更有效的替代攻击。

Result: 通过逼近模型的潜在空间，攻击大幅降低了Tree-Ring检测器ROC和PR曲线的AUC，分别从0.993减少到0.153和从0.994减少到0.385，同时保持高图像质量。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，重用公共自编码器训练扩散模型可能导致安全隐患，Tree-Ring检测器在实际部署中的表现可能不足。

Abstract: We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a
watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility
and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which
rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only
requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the
target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By
leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the
model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based
attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction
in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to
0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image
quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full
access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing
public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by
current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring
detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous
evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.

Result: 在不同的知识场景下评估对抗攻击对先进IDS的有效性，并研究在汽车网络环境中实际应用的可行性。

Conclusion: 攻击的效果依赖于数据集质量、目标IDS以及攻击者的知识程度。

Abstract: The security of modern vehicles has become increasingly important, with the
controller area network (CAN) bus serving as a critical communication backbone
for various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The absence of robust security
measures in CAN, coupled with the increasing connectivity of vehicles, makes
them susceptible to cyberattacks. While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof. Adversarial
attacks, particularly evasion attacks, can manipulate inputs to bypass
detection by IDSs. This paper extends our previous work by investigating the
feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with
different degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs. We consider three
scenarios: white-box (attacker with full system knowledge), grey-box (partial
system knowledge), and the more realistic black-box (no knowledge of the IDS'
internal workings or data). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
attacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.
Additionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack
impact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for
timed injection based on bus traffic. Our results demonstrate that, besides
attacks being challenging due to the automotive domain constraints, their
effectiveness is strongly dependent on the dataset quality, the target IDS, and
the attacker's degree of knowledge.

TL;DR: 研究表明，通过引入外部监控器，能够有效检测和防御分解攻击，提出的轻量级顺序监控框架显著提高了防御成功率，并降低了成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大模型安全防御难以应对分解攻击，这种攻击将恶意目标分解为看似正常的子任务从而规避对抗。现有的对浅层安全对齐技术较弱，无法预测长时间意图。因此，提出了使用外部监视器以更高精度观察对话。

Method: 提出了轻量级的顺序监控框架，该框架能累积评估每个子任务，并与经过精心设计提示的轻量级监视器相结合，达到高防御成功率。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的轻量级监控器在防御分解攻击中实现了93%的成功率，并且仍然能够抵御随机任务注入，同时成本降低90%，延迟减少50%。

Conclusion: 轻量级顺序监控器在减轻分解攻击方面非常有效，并且具有部署的可行性。

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

### [309] [DUN-SRE: Deep Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance for Dynamic MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10309)
*Yuliang Zhu,Jing Cheng,Qi Xie,Zhuo-Xu Cui,Qingyong Zhu,Yuanyuan Liu,Xin Liu,Jianfeng Ren,Chengbo Wang,Dong Liang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DUN-SRE improves dynamic MRI image quality by incorporating spatiotemporal rotation symmetries in its reconstruction model, outperforming existing methods in preserving rotational structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing ECNNs which fail to model temporal symmetry, a critical structural prior in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

Method: The method proposed is a Deep Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE), which incorporates a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture.

Result: The DUN-SRE method shows superior performance in preserving rotation-symmetric structures during dynamic MRI reconstruction, validated by comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets.

Conclusion: DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving rotation-symmetric structures in dynamic MRI reconstruction, showing strong generalization capability.

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

TL;DR: SWDL-Net是一种新的SSL框架，通过结合拉普拉斯金字塔和深度卷积上采样，提升了医学图像的分割性能，特别是在标注数据稀缺的情况下，显著超越了现有的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前医学成像的深度学习分割方法需要大量手工标注的数据。针对颅内出血的标注困难和昂贵的问题，半监督学习成为解决标记数据稀缺的有希望的方案。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的半监督学习框架SWDL-Net，结合拉普拉斯金字塔和深度卷积上采样的优势。拉普拉斯金字塔用于增强边缘，深度卷积用于通过灵活的特征映射提高细节精度。

Result: 在271例ICH数据集和公开基准上的大量实验表明，SWDL-Net在仅有2%标记数据时优于当前最先进的方法。在公开的脑出血分割数据集(BHSD)中，使用5%标记数据的进一步评价也确认了我们方法的优越性。

Conclusion: SWDL-Net是一种新的SSL框架，通过有效地集成拉普拉斯金字塔和深度卷积的方法，实现了对病灶细节和边界的优质分割。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been
released at https://github.com/SIAT-CT-LAB/SWDL.

Motivation: 为了解决传感器在物联网设备上的本地推理计算限制和静态配置问题，开发适应不同计算预算和信道状况的自适应方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于深度神经网络的联合源信道编码策略，以及学习辅助的智能遗传算法（LAIGA），以优化在给定计算预算和SNR下的网络配置。该方法利用随机森林的学习帮助减少超参数空间的探索。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的框架在低SNR下和受限的计算资源中优于固定分割架构和现有的SNR自适应方法，在SNR低至-10dB的情况下提高了10%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的SNR和计算自适应分布式CNN框架在低SNR和有限计算资源条件下表现优于现有方法，在IoT设备的多个计算预算范围内实现了较高的分类准确率。

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational
limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for
server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network
(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and
transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods
rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to
varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless
image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a
learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently
explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under
given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the
infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT
device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to
avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application
specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures
and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited
computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy
as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR
as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M
FLOPs) at IoT device.

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent
years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from
sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these
methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the
Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1)
classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and
(2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we
design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution
generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification
task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval
task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive
Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task
and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at

Motivation: 蛋白质关键残基对蛋白质功能至关重要，因此识别这些残基是非常有意义的。

Method: 本文使用分子动力学模拟来跟踪蛋白质的演变，并学习随机几何图（RGG）以识别关键残基。RGG通过残基对之间状态变量的相关矩阵学习，状态变量为类别数据，相关性通过Cramer's V计算。关键性被参数化为在学到的RGG中的节点度数，通过有机阈值学习RGG并与现有的阈值技术进行比较。此外，根据完整图变量与去掉一个残基后的图变量计算后验概率之差来进行排名，作为关键性度量。第三个参数化方法是在模拟中蛋白质演变时节点度的动态变化。

Result: 通过三种不同的关键性参数，与实验验证的关键残基进行了比较，获得了结果。

Conclusion: 本文提出了三种识别蛋白质关键残基的方法，并与实验验证的关键残基结果进行了比较。

Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since
such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of
recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is
tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning
a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of
156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using
the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given
the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue
pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn
an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when
parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we
develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the
posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues,
and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation
of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the
protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained
with the three distinct criticality parameters, against
experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

Conclusion: 该研究通过外部控制参数优化神经形态网络设备，以学习复杂动态系统。

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled
with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The
neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical
circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear
responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be
performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network
was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic
time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through
manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical
responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive
components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the
memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was
found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to
learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical
neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical
systems using only external control parameters.

Conclusion: 理论研究和有限大小的蒙特卡罗模拟表明，通过引入局部偏差和采用更丰富的隐藏单元先验，可以恢复有序的检索相位，并显著提高召回性能，即便在有限温度下。

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of
bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units -
including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections
to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics
of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation
functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis
reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity
suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as
associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such
as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These
adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall
performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported
by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit
design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

Conclusion: 我们提出的方法能够有效处理动态犯罪环境中拦截犯罪分子的复杂问题，并在较短计算时间内提供高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Intercepting a criminal using limited police resources presents a significant
challenge in dynamic crime environments, where the criminal's location
continuously changes over time. The complexity is further heightened by the
vastness of the transportation network. To tackle this problem, we propose a
layered graph representation, in which each time step is associated with a
duplicate of the transportation network. For any given set of attacker
strategies, a near-optimal defender strategy is computed using the A-Star
heuristic algorithm applied to the layered graph. The defender's goal is to
maximize the probability of successful interdiction. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed method by comparing it with a Mixed-Integer Linear
Programming (MILP) approach used for the defender. The comparison considers
both computational efficiency and solution quality. The results demonstrate
that our approach effectively addresses the complexity of the problem and
delivers high-quality solutions within a short computation time.

Result: 展示了将Gittins指数应用于贝叶斯优化和降低队列尾延迟等实际场景中的优秀表现。

Conclusion: Gittins指数可以成功应用于实际问题，同时也能在某些场景中提供优秀性能的次优解。

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly
optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of
other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often
regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a
practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be
fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven
introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of
problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent
performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the
Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to
minimizing tail latency in queues.

Conclusion: 结合LLMs、静态分析和RAG的综合方法显著提高了代码质量，简化了软件开发过程，并减少了时间和资源的消耗。

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted
and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative
prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to
produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance
and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time
external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates
plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code
Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis
framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code
quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and
resource expenditure.

Conclusion: 提出的评估方法可以帮助揭示LLM代码生成质量如何因用户背景变化而变化，同时这些方法能广泛应用于不同的LLM和编程任务。

Abstract: Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and
accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs
depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and
quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity
with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's
sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic
evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic
persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM
responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are
completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are
widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our
methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating
the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency.
However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug
datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to
reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous,
multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically
generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen
partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic
architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to
ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across
five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional
accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five
times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen
identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,
highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared
against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,
deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and
complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were
employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high
classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming
the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a
scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly
enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at
https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.
