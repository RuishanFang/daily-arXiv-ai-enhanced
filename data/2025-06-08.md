### [1] [GEM: Empowering LLM for both Embedding Generation and Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04344)
*Caojin Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Ke Li,Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati,Benyu Zhang,Jason Liu,Serena Li,Lizhu Zhang,Xiangjun Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出GEM方法使LLM能生成高质量文本嵌入，提升嵌入性能且不影响原有能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的应用如RAG，仍需要单独的嵌入模型生成文本嵌入，这增加了系统复杂性并可能导致查询理解的分歧。

Method: 我们提出了一种自监督方法，即生成式嵌入大型语言模型（GEM），通过在文本中插入特殊标记来生成文本的总结嵌入，不改变模型的生成和推理能力。

Result: 我们的实验表明，在两个流行的LLM家族上应用该方法，显著提升了LLM在MTEB上的表现，同时对MMLU的影响最小。

Conclusion: 我们的方法能够在维持原有NLP性能的同时，大幅提升LLM在文本嵌入方面的表现。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [2] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 增加训练数据中的说话者人数更能提高ASR系统对未见过口音的鲁棒性，应优先增加说话人数而非时长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个可以服务全世界的ASR系统，该系统需要对各种口音，尤其是未见过的口音具有鲁棒性。

Method: 研究三种训练数据变量，即说话者数量、个体说话者的音频时长、口音多样性，如何影响ASR对未见过口音的鲁棒性。

Result: 观察发现，在固定的ASR训练时长条件下，增加说话者人数比每个说话者贡献的小时数更有益，同时增加说话者人数可以使ASR从扩展训练时数中获得性能提升。即便控制了说话者人数，优先选择不同口音的说话者收益最小。

Conclusion: 增加ASR训练数据中的说话人数比增加每个说话者的音频时长更有利于提高系统对未见过口音的鲁棒性。

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

### [3] [Mechanistic Decomposition of Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04373)
*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种方法来解构句子嵌入，使其更透明和可解释，并发现了其中编码的语义和句法特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有句子嵌入的内部结构不透明且不易解释，需要一种方法来提高嵌入的可解释性和透明度。

Method: 采用字典学习对词汇级别表示进行分析，解构句子嵌入并评估其中的潜在特征。

Result: 成功识别和分析了句子嵌入空间中的语义和句法特征，揭示了它们的线性编码方式。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新方法，通过字典学习将句子嵌入解构为可解释的成分。结果表明，许多语义和句法方面已线性编码于嵌入中。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [4] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04381)
*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出HTC-CLIP，通过对比学习结合现有的两种HTC方法，提升了文本分类的性能，Macro F1得分提高0.99 - 2.37%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了将现有的两种捕捉标签层次特征的方法（单独编码和文本编码指导的层次结构）结合起来，增强层次文本分类的性能。

Method: 提出了一种使用对比学习的HTC-CLIP模型，通过对比学习来学习层次感知的文本表示和基于文本的路径引导层次表示。在推理时，结合两种概率分布的池化输出以获得最佳表现。

Result: 在两个公共基准数据集的测试中，HTC-CLIP模型在Macro F1得分上相较现有的最先进模型提高了0.99 - 2.37%。

Conclusion: HTC-CLIP方法将两种现有HTC模型的优点结合到一个架构中，实现了性能的提升。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [5] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了55个大语言模型在马耳他语上的表现，发现预训练中的语言暴露和微调是影响性能的关键，微调效果更好但成本较高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在资源匮乏的马耳他语中的表现，以促进更具包容性的语言技术。

Method: 通过使用新的基准评估了55个公开可用的LLM在马耳他语上的性能，该基准涵盖了11种区分性和生成性任务。

Result: 许多模型表现不佳，特别是在生成任务上，较小的经过微调的模型在所有任务上常常更胜一筹。

Conclusion: 先前在预训练过程中暴露于马耳他语以及指令微调是影响模型性能的最重要因素。微调与提示之间存在权衡，尽管微调初始成本更高，但其提供了更好的性能和更低的推理成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [6] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种嵌入器及分类器模型，在少量标注的情况下实现跨领域意图分类，准确率提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在跨领域的数据资源有限的情况下，构建一个可以通用化的意图分类器，对于提升客户关怀任务具有实际意义。

Method: 采用监督微调方法结合等方差正则化器训练领域特定的句子嵌入器，并运用多语言知识蒸馏策略使其能够跨多个领域泛化。

Result: 在加拿大和墨西哥电商客户关怀数据集上进行少量样本意图识别实验显示，准确率比现有的最先进预训练模型提高了20-23%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在少量注释样本的情况下，可在新的领域中实现更好的意图分类。

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

Abstract: We introduce MedAgentGYM, the first publicly available training environment
designed to enhance coding-based medical reasoning capabilities in large
language model (LLM) agents. MedAgentGYM comprises 72,413 task instances across
129 categories derived from authentic real-world biomedical scenarios. Tasks
are encapsulated within executable coding environments, each featuring detailed
task descriptions, interactive feedback mechanisms, verifiable ground-truth
annotations, and scalable training trajectory generation. Extensive
benchmarking of over 30 LLMs reveals a notable performance disparity between
commercial API-based models and open-source counterparts. Leveraging
MedAgentGYM, Med-Copilot-7B achieves substantial performance gains through
supervised fine-tuning (+36.44%) and continued reinforcement learning
(+42.47%), emerging as an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative
competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [8] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，虽然语言模型在人类规模的预训练数据上能够理解稀有结构的形式，但在意义上仍无法与人类表现媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否具有人类类似的从常见结构泛化到罕见结构的能力，尤其是涉及到这些结构的意义理解。

Method: 测试人类规模的Transformer语言模型对稀有英语结构LET-ALONE形式和意义的理解，通过构建专门的合成基准进行语法和语义特性的评估。

Result: 发现人类规模语言模型对形式敏感，但不能正确推广LET-ALONE结构的意义，表明样本效率在语法形式和语义理解上存在不对称性。

Conclusion: 当前的人类规模语言模型在语法形式上表现出与人类类似的敏感性，但在语义理解上存在明显差距，无法正确推广罕见结构的意义。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

### [10] [Zero-Shot Open-Schema Entity Structure Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04458)
*Xueqiang Xu,Jinfeng Xiao,James Barry,Mohab Elkaref,Jiaru Zou,Pengcheng Jiang,Yunyi Zhang,Max Giammona,Geeth de Mel,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 引入了ZOES，一种无需预定义模式或标注的新方法，通过丰富化、细化和统一化提升LLMs提取实体结构的能力，实验显示该方法在不同领域中的有效性和普适性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于大语言模型通常严重依赖于预定义的实体属性模式或标注数据集，导致提取结果不完整。为了克服这些挑战，提出了无须任意模式或标注样本的新方法。

Method: ZOES通过一个系统化的机制，包括丰富化、细化和统一化来操作，这基于实体及其相关结构相互强化的观点。

Result: 实验表明，ZOES在三个不同领域中始终如一地提升了LLMs提取更完整实体结构的能力。

Conclusion: ZOES方法有效提升了LLMs在不同领域中提取实体结构的能力，并证明了其方法的有效性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [11] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现水印技术可能影响模型的对齐属性，通过提出的 AR 方法可以缓解这些影响，恢复基线对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对水印技术如何影响大型语言模型在真相性、安全性和有用性上的研究，尤其是在这些核心对齐属性上的影响。

Method: 提出了一种名为 AR (Alignment Resampling) 的推理时采样方法，通过使用外部奖励模型来恢复对齐，同时在实验中修改了 Gumbel 水印实现，以牺牲严格的无失真性来提高响应多样性。

Result: 实验结果表明，AR 成功恢复了在两种水印方法中的基线对齐，同时保持了强大的水印可检测性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了水印强度和模型对齐之间的关键平衡，提供了一种简单的推理时解决方案，能够在实践中负责任地部署加水印的大型语言模型。

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PUGC框架利用用户生成内容中的隐式偏好，以低成本提高大语言模型响应质量，并在性能上超越传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好学习方法过于依赖人工或高级模型生成的精选数据，成本高且难以扩大规模。

Method: 提出了PUGC框架，它利用未标记的用户生成内容中的隐式人类偏好生成偏好数据。通过将UGC转化为查询并生成响应，然后以UGC作为参照文本进行评分，使模型与这些隐式偏好对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用DPO和PUGC训练的模型在Alpaca Eval 2上比传统方法提高了9.37%的性能，并在使用Mistral-7B-Instruct时达到了35.93%的长度控制赢率，设立了新的记录。

Conclusion: PUGC框架通过利用UGC中的隐式人类偏好，成功实现了人类价值对齐，并且与现有方法相比提高了生成响应的质量。

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

### [13] [SQLens: An End-to-End Framework for Error Detection and Correction in Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04494)
*Yue Gong,Chuan Lei,Xiao Qin,Kapil Vaidya,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy,Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLens框架通过精细检测和纠正语义错误，提高了文本到SQL系统的查询准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型在将自然语言转换为SQL查询时，通常会生成语法正确但语义错误的查询，缺乏对其可靠性的深入了解。

Method: 提出SQLens框架，通过整合底层数据库和LLM的错误信号，精细检测和纠正LLM生成的SQL中的语义错误。

Result: 在两个公共基准上的实验证明，SQLens在错误检测方面的F1得分比最佳的LLM自我评估方法高出25.78%，并提升了现成的文本到SQL系统的执行准确性最多20%。

Conclusion: SQLens有效提高了LLM生成SQL的语义正确性，改善了系统的交互表现。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

*Kun Zhao,Bohao Yang,Chen Tang,Siyuan Dai,Haoteng Tang,Chenghua Lin,Liang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过SLIDE和DRE方法结合SLMs和LLMs，研究改善了对话评估准确性，增强了与人类判断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs虽然在多项任务中表现优异，但在存在多个有效响应的模糊场景下难以稳定地输出结果；而SLMs在这些场景中表现出色，但易受误导性输入影响。为了利用两者的互补优势，作者提出新方法。

Method: 提出SLIDE方法，结合SLMs和LLMs，并通过自适应加权增强两者的优势；进一步提出双精炼评估（DRE）方法，通过SLM引导LLM产生初始评估，并利用SLM调整优化LLM评分。

Result: 实验结果表明，DRE方法在与人类判断的对齐方面优于现有方法，并在多种基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: 通过结合小型语言模型（SLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs），SLIDE和DRE方法提高了对话评估的准确性，更好地与人类判断保持一致。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

*Di Wu,Seth Aycock,Christof Monz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型中的分步提示策略在翻译中未必有效，简单提示再次翻译可能更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试手工设计的提示分解策略在翻译中的有效性，并寻找更好的翻译提示方法。

Method: 对当前的基于LLM的翻译策略进行审查，并通过不同的提示方法进行实验对比，得出结论。

Result: 发现简单地提示大型语言模型“再次翻译”比分步提示能取得更好的翻译效果。

Conclusion: 通过明确分解翻译过程来提高性能并没有明显的证据，简单地提示大型语言模型再次翻译的效果甚至更好。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

TL;DR: LLMs在区分话语粒子"just"的细致语义能力有限，特别是在处理细微差别时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs能否区别英语中多功能的话语粒子"just"的细致语义，通过这一研究揭示这些模型在话语理解中的缺陷。

Method: 使用由专家语言学家精心制作和标注的语料库，对LLMs区分英语中"just"的细致语义能力进行了调查。

Result: 研究结果表明，LLMs在区分较宽泛的类别上表现出一定的能力，但对于捕捉更微妙的语义差异仍然存在困难。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了大型语言模型（LLMs）尽管能够区分较宽泛的类别，但在捕捉更微妙的细微差别上仍存在困难，体现了其在理解话语粒子方面的缺陷。

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

TL;DR: 该研究通过引入SSA-MTE数据集和改进的评估模型，显著提升了非洲低资源语言的机器翻译评估质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器翻译评估工具在低资源环境下表现不佳，特别是针对非洲语言的资源不足。研究者希望通过发展新的评估方法来提升机器翻译质量。

Method: 研究引入了SSA-MTE，一个覆盖13种非洲语言对的大规模人工注释的机器翻译评估数据集，并基于此开发了SSA-COMET和SSA-COMET-QE模型。这些模型是改进的基于参考和无参考的评估指标。研究还使用最先进的LLM进行基准测试。

Result: SSA-COMET模型显著优于此前的AfriCOMET，并在低资源语言上与最强大的LLM（如Gemini 2.5 Pro）竞争。此外，所有资源都以开放许可证发布，以支持未来的研究。

Conclusion: 引入的SSA-MTE数据集和SSA-COMET评估模型有效提升了非洲语言的机器翻译评估质量，特别是在低资源环境下。开放资源有利于推动相关领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究表明，恶意代理可通过微妙的提示操控多代理系统，并绕过现有监控，需要更强的安全和内容验证机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多代理系统虽然能促进分布式代理合作，但其也容易受到恶意代理的操控，从而偏向于满足自利目标而不影响核心功能。研究探讨了代理如何通过细微的提示操控多代理系统以获取各种利益。

Method: 研究分析了四种攻击类型：替罪羊攻击者引导系统监控误估其他代理的贡献；夸耀者引导系统监控高估自己的表现；自我交易者引导其他代理采用特定工具；搭便车者将自己的任务交给其他代理。

Result: 通过策略性设计的提示，可以在多代理系统的行为和可执行指令中引入系统性偏差，使恶意代理能够有效误导评价系统和操作协作代理。

Conclusion: 恶意代理通过谨慎设计的提示词可以影响多代理系统的运作，甚至绕过当前先进的LLM监控，包括GPT-4o-mini和o3-mini。这表明，需要在多代理系统架构中加入强有力的安全协议和内容验证机制，并开发能够全面评估风险情境的监控系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，在金融情感分析中，快速直观的思维模式比慢速推理更有效，挑战了推理越多决策越好的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在零样本金融情感分析中的有效性，以及推理模型和非推理模型在此任务中的表现。

Method: 使用被领域专家标注的金融短语库数据集，评估不同的LLMs及提示策略与人类标注情感的对齐程度，比较了三种专有大语言模型在不同提示模式下的表现，并与用于金融情感分析的两个小型模型进行基准测试。

Result: 推理能力（无论是通过提示还是模型设计）并没有提升任务表现，相反，GPT-4o在无任何链式思维提示下的表现最为准确且与人类一致。发现推理可能引发过度思考，导致次优预测。

Conclusion: 在零样本金融情感分析中，快速、直觉的"System 1"思维比慢速、审慎的"System 2"思维更能与人类判断一致，尤其在金融应用中，更多的推理并不总能导致更好的模型决策。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLM在处理词汇多样化问题上存在不足之处，现有逻辑推理基准缺乏词汇多样性，导致无法有效测试LLM的这方面能力。

Method: 提出了SCALe基准以测试LLMs在词汇多样化情况下的翻译能力，并开发了MenTaL方法，通过在上下文学习和监督微调中统一多样化表达的表格来改善LLM翻译。

Result: 实验确认当前LLM在应对逻辑不变的词汇多样化方面存在不足，MenTaL方法在该背景下显著提升了LLM翻译性能。

Conclusion: MenTaL方法能够显著提高LLM在词汇多样化文本上的翻译性能。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多示例选择方法仅限于随机选择，传统的实例级检索不适用于多示例场景，作者假设在上下文学习和微调之间的数据需求是类似的。

Method: 引入了一种新的渐变匹配方法，该方法通过对齐微调梯度选择适当的演示样例，以实现更高效的任务学习。

Result: 该方法在多种语言模型和数据集上的表现均优于随机选择，特别是在从4-shot到128-shot场景的测试中，展示了显著的结果提升。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新的渐变匹配方法用于选择演示，通过对齐目标任务的整个训练集的微调梯度与所选示例，从而在所选示例中接近对整个训练集的学习效果。该方法在各类多样化数据集中多个场景中表现优异。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SUCEA 是一种无需训练的事实核查框架，通过分解和编辑对抗性声明，提高了证据检索和蕴涵标签的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动事实核查作为对抗虚假信息的一种手段，近年来受到更多关注。即使有了显著进展，基于检索增强语言模型的事实核查系统仍难以应对故意设计的人为对抗性声明。这些声明的目的是为了挑战事实核查系统。

Method: 我们提出了一种无需训练的方法，该方法可以重新表述原始声明，使其更容易找到支持证据。我们的模块化框架 SUCEA 将任务分解为三个步骤：1) 声明分段和去上下文化，将对抗性声明分段为独立的子声明；2) 迭代证据检索和声明编辑，根据检索到的证据迭代检索证据并编辑子声明；3) 证据聚合和标签预测，聚合所有检索到的证据并预测蕴涵标签。

Result: 实验结果表明，SUCEA 框架显著提高了检索和蕴涵标签的准确性，优于四个强大的基于声明分解的基线方法。

Conclusion: 我们的框架 SUCEA 在两个具有挑战性的事实核查数据集上进行了实验，结果表明在检索和蕴涵标签准确性上都有显著提升，并且优于四个强大的基于声明分解的基线。

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

TL;DR: 引入MuSciClaims基准以测试科学文献中的数据验证能力，发现视觉语言模型在多模态诉求验证上表现不佳，存在偏见和误判。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管科学问答、图表说明等领域已有大量工作，但在多模态诉求验证方面仍然缺乏直接测试能力的基准。

Method: 我们引入了一个新的基准MuSciClaims，同时设计了一些诊断任务来评估模型在科学文献中的数据提取和推理能力。我们通过自动提取科学文章中的支持性声明并人为地扰动这些声明来测试模型的验证能力。

Result: 大多数视觉语言模型的表现较差，F1分数约为0.3至0.5，最好的模型也仅达到0.77。模型倾向于判断诉求为支持性，难以正确识别图表中的证据、整合跨模态信息并理解基本图表组件。

Conclusion: 目前的视觉语言模型在多模态科学数据的诉求验证上表现不佳，存在严重的偏见和误判。

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

Method: 通过大语言模型对自动语音识别或翻译生成的文本进行修正，结合数据过滤策略来优化知识转移效率。并进行消融研究来探讨不同LLM和提示配置的效果。

Result: 在普通话ASR和西班牙语到英语AST任务上，LESS在Wenet Speech测试集上实现3.77%的WER绝对降低，在Callhome和Fisher测试集上分别获得34.0和64.7的BLEU分数。

Conclusion: LESS框架通过利用大语言模型改进自动语音识别和自动语音翻译生成的伪标签，显著提高了WER和BLEU指标，证明了其在不同语言、任务和领域的适应性。

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

Motivation: 由于大语言模型在推理过程中存在误判的问题，当前的方法如过程奖励模型或自我一致性操作为不透明盒子，无法提供可检查的证据，这可能限制其效果。

Method: 提出一种回顾性、步骤感知形式化验证框架，称为$Safe$，使用形式数学语言Lean 4来表述数学声明，并提供形式证明来识别误判。

Conclusion: 这是第一次尝试利用形式化数学语言Lean 4来验证由大语言模型生成的自然语言内容，为易于误判的人类书写证明提供稳健的基础。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Motivation: 现有科学NLI数据集只涵盖计算机科学领域，其他学科领域被忽视。因此，有必要引入一个涵盖非计算机科学领域的科学NLI评估基准，以填补这一空白。

Method: 研究中建立了强大的基线模型，使用了小型预训练语言模型(SLMs)和大型语言模型(LLMs)进行评估。此外，通过在模型训练中引入具有隐含科学NLI关系的句子对，研究提高了NLI任务的性能。

Result: 该研究在MISMATCHED基准上取得了最好的基线表现，Macro F1仅为78.17%，显示出未来改进的巨大空间。此外，通过模型训练中的新方法提高了科学NLI性能。

Conclusion: 本研究引入了一个新的用于科学NLI评估的基准，称为MISMATCHED，涵盖了心理学、工程和公共卫生三个非计算机科学领域。这一基准展示了在非CS领域科学NLI任务上的巨大改进空间。

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理优化模型输出的多样性较低，限制了TTS（Test-Time Scaling）效果。为了提高TTS在推理任务中的有效性，提出了一种新的方法。

Method: 提出了ADAPT（A Diversity Aware Prefix fine-Tuning）方法，通过前缀微调结合多样性关注的数据策略来提升模型的推理能力。

Result: 在数学推理任务的实验中，ADAPT方法在使用比强基线少八倍计算资源的情况下达到了80%的准确率。

Conclusion: ADAPT显著提高了模型在推理任务中的性能，同时大大减少了计算资源的使用，强调了生成多样性在最大化TTS效率中的关键作用。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的静态词嵌入，通过平均词嵌入表示句子，显著提高了句子语义任务的性能，并成功去除与句子语义无关的词嵌入成分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种新的静态词嵌入以优化句子语义表示，从而提高句子语义任务的性能。

Method: 从预训练的Sentence Transformer中提取词嵌入，通过句子层次的主成分分析进行改进，然后通过知识蒸馏或对比学习进行进一步优化。在推理过程中，通过简单的词嵌入平均来表示句子。

Result: 模型在句子语义任务上的表现明显优于现有的静态模型，并且在某些数据集上甚至与基本的Sentence Transformer模型(如SimCSE)相媲美。

Conclusion: 提出的新静态词嵌入能够有效消除与句子语义无关的词嵌入成分，并根据词语对句子语义的影响调整向量范数，从而提升句子语义表示的质量。

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

### [31] [Advancing Tool-Augmented Large Language Models via Meta-Verification and Reflection Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04625)
*Zhiyuan Ma,Jiayu Liu,Xianzhen Luo,Zhenya Huang,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tool-MVR is an advanced tool-augmented language model that enhances tool planning and reflection, outperforming existing models and demonstrating high error correction rates on specific benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of current language models, namely unreliable tool planning due to low-quality datasets and poor tool reflection abilities.

Method: Tool-MVR is developed through two key innovations: 1) Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV) to improve tool planning and invocation by creating the ToolBench-V dataset. 2) Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE) to enhance tool reflection through a dynamic learning paradigm, resulting in the ToolBench-R dataset.

Result: Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing ToolLLM by 23.9% and GPT-4 by 15.3%, while reducing API calls by 31.4% and displaying strong generalization. It also achieves a 58.9% error correction rate on RefineToolBench, outperforming ToolLLM significantly.

Conclusion: Tool-MVR exhibits significant improvement over existing models in tool utilization and reflection, evidenced by superior performance on StableToolBench and RefineToolBench benchmarks.

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AVSR在噪声环境中具有优势，但数据集的匮乏限制了其应用，尤其体现在大多数非英语语言上。

Method: 开发一种从视频中自动生成AVSR数据集的方法，提升其效率和可及性。

Result: 自动生成的数据集在噪声环境下表现优异，显著超过传统的ASR系统。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了一种自动生成AVSR数据集的方法，可以有效支持越南语等语言的基线模型开发。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 引入了一种无需训练的KV缓存压缩方法TaDA，通过适应层间误差敏感性进行量化，实现异常值处理的简化，并在减少内存的同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存是变压器模型中的关键组件，其内存需求随序列长度呈现不良扩展，影响大规模语言模型的可扩展性。通过量化KV缓存以改进内存利用率，提升解码或推理效率。

Method: 引入TaDA方法，这是一种无需训练的KV缓存压缩方案，采用根据误差敏感性调整的量化精度，并通过均值中心化消除单独的异常值处理需求。

Result: 实验表明，该技术可将KV缓存的内存占用减少至原始16位基线的27%，同时维持相当的准确度。

Conclusion: TaDA方法显著改进了多个模型在不同上下文长度下的准确性，且无需单独管理异常值元素，为语言模型的可扩展性及高性能推理开辟了新路径。

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

TL;DR: 引入Flex-TravelPlanner基准以评估语言模型在动态规划场景中的灵活推理能力，发现模型在多轮适应和约束优先级处理方面存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于评估大语言模型规划能力的基准主要集中于静态的单轮场景，因此，需要一种能够在动态规划场景中灵活推理的评估方法。

Method: 通过引入两个新的评估设置：（1）在多轮中逐步引入约束；（2）包含明显优先级竞争的约束场景。

Result: 对GPT-4o和Llama 3.1 70B的分析显示，单轮任务表现不能很好地预测模型跨多轮适应计划的能力；约束引入顺序显著影响表现；模型在约束优先级方面存在问题，经常错误地偏向新加入的较低优先级偏好而非已有的高优先级约束。

Conclusion: 强调需要在更现实的动态规划场景中评估大语言模型的能力，并指出提高模型在复杂规划任务上的表现的重要改进方向。

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

TL;DR: 研究发现，现有对齐方法无法防止对抗攻击，AI模型需具备更深层次的规范推理能力以增强其安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型等AI系统的进步，人们对其安全部署的担忧日益加剧。因此，研究探讨现有对齐策略是否能够有效防止LLM的误用非常重要。

Method: 通过借鉴道德心理学的研究，分析现有对齐方法的局限性，探讨其在阻止滥用上的不足。

Result: 研究表明，LLM缺乏检测和理性解决规范冲突的能力，即使是最近在推理能力方面的进展也未能解决这一问题。这种"浅层对齐"问题对AI安全和监管有重要影响。

Conclusion: 现有的LLM对齐方法仅强化了浅层行为倾向，而未能赋予模型真正的规范推理能力，因此无法防止被对抗攻击利用。

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于互联网上天然数据池的增长速度无法跟上算力供应的速度，且高质量文本的可用性更为有限，因此需要找到方法来应对预训练扩展中的“数据墙”问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为REWIRE的方法，能够通过指导性的重写来丰富低质量文档，使其在训练中变得有用。

Result: 通过在DCLM基准测试中的1B、3B和7B规模实验表明，混合高质量原始文本和重写后的文本在22个不同任务中分别获得了1.0、1.3和2.5个百分点的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过使用REWIRE方法，可以有效地回收和再利用互联网上被过滤掉的低质量文本，从而提高大型语言模型的预训练效果。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Motivation: 自动检测技术在识别显性仇恨言论上表现良好，但挑战在于识别更加隐晦的隐性仇恨言论。

Method: 提出两种方法将编码类型整合到隐性仇恨言论检测中：直接提示大型语言模型进行分类，或在编码过程中嵌入编码类型。

Result: 实验表明，编码类型的使用提高了隐性仇恨言论检测的效果，涵盖中英文数据集。

Conclusion: 使用编码类型可以有效改善隐性仇恨言论检测的性能，适用于多种语言数据集。

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

TL;DR: HSSBench is a new benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in Humanities and Social Sciences, addressing the need for interdisciplinary reasoning assessment. It presents challenges for current models, aiming to inspire advancements in cross-disciplinary capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM benchmarks focus on STEM disciplines and neglect the interdisciplinary and abstract reasoning required in the Humanities and Social Sciences. There's a gap that needs to be addressed to enhance MLLMs' capabilities in HSS domains.

Method: The paper introduces HSSBench, a benchmark for assessing the performance of MLLMs on tasks in the Humanities and Social Sciences. It includes a novel data generation pipeline where domain experts and automated agents work together to create and refine samples. The benchmark was tested on over 20 MLLMs.

Result: HSSBench was created with more than 13,000 carefully designed samples across six categories. Testing on more than 20 mainstream MLLMs revealed significant challenges for even advanced models, underscoring the difficulty of these tasks.

Conclusion: HSSBench represents a significant step forward in evaluating MLLMs in the context of Humanities and Social Sciences, highlighting the need for improved interdisciplinary reasoning in these models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的方法需要大量计算资源，因此存在性能与效率之间的关键权衡。为解决此问题，需要一种高效而不牺牲准确性的解码方法。

Method: 介绍了一种名为STAND的推测解码方法，通过利用推理路径中的冗余性和高效的N-gram模块，实现高效的模型无关的令牌预测。

Result: STAND在推理延迟方面减少60-65%且维持精确度，并且在吞吐量方面比先进的方法高出14-28%。

Conclusion: STAND是一种无需模型的推测解码方法，可以大幅加速推理同时保持精度，是一种强大的即插即用解决方案。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单个模型在生成多样性和评估中存在不足，因此提出了让多个LLM组成“斯巴达部落”进行竞争，以弥补不足。

Method: 通过竞争和战斗的方式，将多个大型语言模型（LLM）进行集体校准。采用适应的elo排名信誉系统，根据竞争结果调整评估权重，并从竞争偏好对中学习。

Result: SPARTA ALIGNMENT在12个任务和数据集中的10个任务上取得了比初始模型和自我对齐基线高7.0%的平均改进。

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT在多任务中的表现优于初始模型和自我校准基线模型，并展现出更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

Method: 提出了一个多轮协作学习框架，以及一个基于专家混合架构的终身知识编辑模块，结合重播式持续学习方法。

Result: 在 Pheme 和 Twitter16 数据集上的大量实验表明，C$^2$EFND 显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: C$^2$EFND 框架在连续新兴假新闻场景中显著提高了检测准确性和适应性。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

*Léane Jourdan,Florian Boudin,Richard Dufour,Nicolas Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了传统评价指标的局限性，并探索了更符合人工评判的替代评价方法。结果表明，结合LLM和任务特定指标的混合方法有效评估文本修订质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评价指标如ROUGE和BERTScore主要关注相似性，难以捕捉有意义的改进。

Method: 首先进行人工注释研究来评估不同修订的质量，随后考察来自NLP相关领域的无参考评估指标，并分析LLM-as-a-judge评估方法，对比其在有无金标准参考下评估修订的能力。

Result: 结果显示，LLM在评估指令执行的有效性方面表现良好，但在评估正确性上有所欠缺，而领域特定指标提供了补充性的洞察。

Conclusion: 结合LLM作为评审的评估方法和任务特定的指标，可以提供对修订质量的最可靠评估。

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

*Jingyu Hu,Mengyue Yang,Mengnan Du,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探究LLM内部的政治倾向，通过多维框架设计和概念向量学习以提高透明度，试验证明其有效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLM政治观点的研究主要依赖于对其生成回答的评估，而这些回答与其内部意图之间可能存在不一致。这激发了对LLM内部机制进行探究以揭示其内部政治状态的动机。同时, 现有研究多依赖于单一轴线的概念分析，可能导致概念混淆，因此引入多维度分析以改进透明度和准确性。

Method: 研究者设计了一种四维政治学习框架，并构建了一个数据集进行细粒度政治概念向量的学习。然后在八个开源LLM上进行试验，采用了三种表示工程技术对结果进行验证。

Result: 试验结果表明，这些政治概念向量能够化解政治概念混淆。检测任务验证了向量的语义意义，并在OOD（Out-Of-Distribution）设置中表现出良好的泛化性和鲁棒性。干预实验则展示了这些向量可以用于干预LLM以生成具有不同政治倾向的响应。

Conclusion: 通过设计四维政治学习框架及建立相应数据集，该研究首次在LLM的内部机制中，实现了细粒度政治概念向量的学习和应用。这些概念向量有助于检测、揭示并在需要时干预LLM的政治倾向。实验证明了这些向量在语义上的有效性及其在不同场景中的良好泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

*Dingdong Wang,Jincenzi Wu,Junan Li,Dongchao Yang,Xueyuan Chen,Tianhua Zhang,Helen Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMSU benchmark is introduced to evaluate and improve spoken language understanding in SpeechLLMs, indicating significant improvement potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural speech by current SpeechLLMs.

Method: MMSU comprises audio-question-answer triplets and systematically incorporates linguistic phenomena for evaluation.

Result: Identified substantial room for improvement in existing SpeechLLMs and provided directions for future optimization.

Conclusion: MMSU establishes a new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding, offering valuable insights for enhancing human-AI speech interaction systems.

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

TL;DR: 该调查针对MLLMs进行了深入分析，提出了一个分类框架以帮助理解多模态信息与语言模型的融合技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献在多模态信息与语言模型融合上存在显著的研究空白。

Method: 从三个关键维度对MLLMs进行分类：架构策略、表征学习技术以及训练范式。

Result: 通过分析研究125个MLLMs，我们识别出了领域中的新兴模式。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一个分类框架，为MLLMs的研究提供了系统的综述和指导。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FineLogic is a new framework to evaluate logical reasoning in LLMs, focusing on benchmark accuracy, soundness, and alignment. The study finds that natural language supervision enhances generalization and symbolic styles improve structural soundness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the evaluation of logical reasoning in LLMs, which is often assessed only by final-answer accuracy without considering the quality and structure of the reasoning process.

Method: This study uses a fine-grained evaluation framework called FineLogic, which assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions, combined with an experiment on supervision formats during fine-tuning (natural language and symbolic variants).

Result: Natural language supervision leads to strong generalization, even on out-of-distribution and long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles encourage structurally sound and atomic inference chains.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning primarily enhances reasoning behaviors through step-by-step generation, not shortcut prediction or internalized correctness.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了结合 CNN 和 BERT 的混合模型来提高翻译校对质量，达到了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动翻译常有错误，需要大量人工编辑，本研究旨在提升翻译质量，通过更好的校对手段来减少错误。

Method: 结合卷积神经网络（CNN）和双向编码器表示转换模型（BERT）的混合方法，通过 CNN 提取局部 n 元模式，通过 BERT 创建上下文丰富的表示，并使用注意力机制进行错误检测，结合 GRU 解码器模型调整翻译。

Result: 实验结果表明，模型在多域数据集上达到90%的准确率，89.37%的F1得分和16.24%的MSE，比最近校对技术高出10%以上。

Conclusion: 新提出的方法在校对翻译错误及遗漏方面表现出色，显示了最先进的性能水平。

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLM和LLM在未充分研究的教育环境中的实际应用效果。

Method: 通过对646份来自印尼六所学校四年级学生的手写考试答卷进行性能评价，内容包括数学和英语两个科目。

Result: 尽管LLM生成的反馈在某种程度上仍有用处，但在个性化和上下文相关性方面依然存在局限。

Conclusion: VLM在识别学生手写内容时表现不佳，导致在后续LLM评分中出现错误传播问题。

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球范围内每天发布的具有挑战性的密码填字游戏线索。

Method: 建立基于LLM的推理系统，通过假定答案、提出文字游戏解释以及使用验证器系统来解决谜题。

Result: 实现了新的最先进表现，使得对解决方案的推理可以通过Python代码进行解释和检查。

Conclusion: 该系统在Cryptonite数据集上取得了新的最先进表现。

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

TL;DR: 本文提出RACE框架，可有效检测大规模推理模型中的幻觉并超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的幻觉检测方法难以识别来自模型推理轨迹的幻觉或逻辑不一致性，而对于LRMs来说这种推理轨迹是决策过程的重要支撑，同时也是潜在幻觉的重要来源。

Method: 提出RACE框架，通过萃取核心推理步骤并计算四个诊断信号：推理轨迹的样本间一致性、基于熵的答案不确定性、推理与答案的语义对齐性以及推理的内部一致性来检测幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，RACE框架在不同数据集和语言模型上均超越现有的幻觉检测基线。

Conclusion: RACE框架在检测大规模推理模型（LRMs）中的幻觉方面表现优于现有的方法，是一种可靠且可推广的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is

Motivation: 现有的翻译文本平行语料库及其关联的对齐算法难以填补这一空白，因为它们无法有效建模语音段落间的长程交互或处理原始和口译语音间的特定分歧。因此，研究需要专用的数据集和分析、监测与评估的工具。

Method: 引入MockConf数据集，包含从学生模拟会议中收集的7小时录音，并进行转录和词级对齐。实现并发布InterAlign网络注释工具，并提出评估度量和自动对齐基线。

Result: 发布了具备5种欧洲语言、7小时录音内容的MockConf数据集以及InterAlign网络注释工具，为同步口译对齐提供了新的评估方法和自动对齐基线。

Conclusion: 研究引入了MockConf学生口译数据集，并发布了适用于同步口译对齐的现代化网络注释工具InterAlign，提供了评估和自动对齐的基线。数据集和工具已发布给社区。

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在教育背景下集成人工智能（AI）已经带来了新的学习方法，变革了学生和教育者的实践。其中，大型语言模型（LLMs）被视为创造教育材料和回答问题的有力工具，但仍有新的应用空间。然而，创建选择题是一项资源密集的任务，耗费大量时间和认知努力。LLMs为这些挑战提供了有前途的解决方案。

Method: 本研究对三种广为人知的大型语言模型（LLMs）——Llama 2、Mistral和GPT-3.5进行比较分析，以探讨其生成信息量大且具有挑战性的选择题的潜力。在方法上，本研究不依赖于LLM自身的知识，而是通过注入知识到提示中来降低模型产生幻觉的可能性，使教育工作者能够控制测试的原始文本。

Result: 实验涉及21名教育工作者，结果显示GPT-3.5在几个已知指标上生成的选择题最为有效。此外，研究也显示教育领域仍存在采用AI技术的部分犹豫。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明，GPT-3.5在生成有效的选择题方面表现最佳，同时也强调了教育领域在接受AI技术上的迟疑。这为未来提高教育体验提供了宝贵的见解。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在各种语言对下，等长机器翻译的有效性，特别是在IWSLT 2022等长共享任务的条件下。

Method: 本研究使用了8个不同规模的开源大型语言模型，探讨了不同提示策略、少样本示例数量和示例选择如何影响翻译质量和长度控制。

Result: 实验表明，只有在提供极端示例时，大型语言模型才倾向于生成较短的翻译，而等长示例常常导致模型忽视长度限制。少样本提示通常可提高翻译质量，但在5、10和20示例设置下进一步改善有限。

Conclusion: 通过考虑多重输出，可以显著改善翻译长度与质量之间的权衡。

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Motivation: 尽管 Universal Dependencies 是跨语言句法表示的最成功的语言框架之一，但在其有效性方面仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 将 Universal Dependencies 整合到预训练语言模型中，并在跨语言对抗性释义识别任务中进行评估。

Result: 整合 UD 后，准确率和 F1 分数分别平均提高了 3.85% 和 6.08%。在某些语言对中，预训练模型与大型语言模型之间的性能差距缩小，甚至在某些情况下超越了后者。此外，给定语言与英语之间的 UD 基于相似性分数与该语言中模型的表现呈正相关。

Conclusion: UD 的整合能够显著提高跨语言对抗性释义识别任务中的预训练语言模型的表现。

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的评估指标无法充分评估大型语言模型在实际竞争环境中的编码能力及反思能力，需要更具挑战性和现实性的基准测试来评估其推理能力。

Method: ICPC-Eval通过118个国际大学生程序设计竞赛（ICPC）问题，提供真实的竞赛环境、稳健的测试用例生成方法以及有效的测试时间缩放评估指标Refine@K。

Result: 顶级推理模型如DeepSeek-R1，依赖多轮代码反馈以完全发挥其背景推理潜力，但在代码生成方面仍落后于人类团队。

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval展示了当前大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中的显著挑战，即便是先进的推理模型在与顶尖人类团队比较时仍显不足。

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 引入一个新的基准Verbose ListOps，专注于测试语言模型在嵌套叙事推理中的状态管理能力，揭示了当前模型在这方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法提供真实干扰因素，或无法将上下文长度与推理复杂性解耦，从而掩盖了大语言模型的根本局限性。

Method: 提出了Verbose ListOps基准，其通过将ListOps计算编程性地转换为长篇连贯的故事，强制要求对嵌套推理问题进行内部计算和状态管理。

Result: 实验表明，领先的大语言模型在较适中的叙事情境长度（约10k标记）下，表现显著下降，尽管它们能够轻松解决原始的ListOps方程。

Conclusion: 现有的长上下文和多跳问答基准无法有效测试语言模型的嵌套叙事推理能力，而Verbose ListOps基准展示了语言模型在嵌套推理问题上的状态管理难题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合混合HMM和自监督模型的新方法，在低资源语言ASR系统中实现了超过微调模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑广泛认为微调多语种端到端模型会产生最佳效果的观点，提出一种可能更有效的替代方案。

Method: 实现了一种将混合隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）与自监督模型结合的方法，通过持续的自监督预训练和半监督训练，更好地利用所有可用的语音和文本数据。

Result: 在苏格兰盖尔语的试验中，与最佳微调Whisper模型相比，词错误率（WER）相对减少了32%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的结合混合HMM和自监督模型的方法在低资源语言ASR系统中表现优于现有的微调多语种端到端模型的方法。

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

TL;DR: 该研究模拟了多语言环境下导师与学生的互动，结果显示，在低资源语言中使用符合学生母语的提示可以显著提高学习成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在生成英语教学反馈方面显示了能力，但其在不同语言中提供有效教学支持的能力，尤其是数学推理任务方面，尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用一个更强大的模型来模拟导师角色，生成提示性反馈，同时用一个较弱的模型来模拟学生，进行大规模多语言导师-学生互动模拟。

Result: 研究表明，多语言提示在低资源语言中可以显著提高学习效果，特别是当反馈语言与学生母语一致时。

Conclusion: 多语言提示能够显著改善学习成果，特别是在学生母语与反馈语言一致的低资源语言中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于Transformer的模型改善了翻译效果，但在词汇歧义和上下文理解上仍然存在困难，特别是在领域特定应用中。

Method: 我们调查并比较了适用于上下文感知翻译的不同方法，包括测试视觉语言模型（VLM）和将上下文信息（如产品类别路径或图像描述）融入文本到文本模型。

Result: 研究结果表明，结合上下文信息可以提升机器翻译的质量，并公开了新的数据集。

Conclusion: 结合上下文信息可以提高机器翻译的质量。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种增量的半监督学习方法，通过一致性和NER过滤提高了预训练ASR模型的微调效果，在标注数据稀缺的情况下实现了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标注数据稀缺的情况下，为特定领域微调预训练的自动语音识别模型具有挑战性。然而，未标注音频和相关领域的标注数据通常是可用的。

Method: 提出了一种增量的半监督学习流程，首先将小规模的域内标注集与来自相近领域的辅助数据集整合。然后通过多模型一致性或命名实体识别（NER）进行过滤，以选择和逐步优化伪标签。

Result: 在多域的Wow呼叫中心和Fisher English语料库上进行评估，表现优于单步微调。基于一致性的过滤性能优于其他方法，比随机选择的单步微调提供最多22.3%的相对改进（Wow）和24.8%的改进（Fisher）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过多模型一致性过滤和命名实体识别的方法可以在稀缺标注数据的领域中提高预训练ASR模型的微调效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

TL;DR: SCOP分析表明，LLMs在专家水平的理解过程中仍有挑战，表现出地方信息理解优于整体信息，且可能在错误理解过程中得出正确答案，需改进理解技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在机器理解方面有巨大潜力，但在现实世界中完全依赖它们还是令人不安的，因为没有合理的解释说明其理解过程是否与专家对齐。

Method: 提出SCOP方法，从认知视角检查LLMs的理解过程。具体来说，定义了理解过程中的五项必备技能，构建严格的测试数据框架，并详细分析开放和闭源的LLMs。

Result: 通过SCOP分析发现，LLMs在类似专家的理解过程方面仍具挑战性。它们在理解局部信息方面表现较好，但在整体信息的理解上存在不足。此外，模型可能在错误的理解过程中得出正确答案。

Conclusion: 研究发现，尽管大型语言模型在理解过程方面表现出一些与专家相似的特点，但仍然具有挑战性。它们在理解地方信息方面表现较好，但在整体信息的理解上存在不足。此外，模型可能在错误的理解过程中得出正确答案，因此需要改进模型的理解过程。

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法需要复杂的模型改动，限制了与预训练模型的兼容性。

Method: 通过在交叉熵损失计算中增加对EOS标记正确预测的重要性来控制自动文本摘要的长度。

Result: 该方法已经在编码器-解码器模型和现代GPT风格的大型语言模型中测试，对生成长度的控制效果显著且通常不影响摘要的质量。

Conclusion: 提出了一种简单的方法，通过在交叉熵损失计算中增加对EOS标记正确预测的重要性来控制生成文本的长度。这种方法对模型架构和解码算法没有依赖性，且与其他控制生成长度的推断技术相辅相成。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH-500等数学任务上表现强劲，同时在超越数学领域的基准测试如MMLU和CommonsenseQA中同样表现出色。

Conclusion: AR-Checker在多个基准测试上表现出色，包括数学任务和其他领域的推理任务，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

Method: 作者提供了两个LLMs的自我报告示例，并对其进行批判性分析以探讨内省性。

Result: LLMs在推测自身温度参数时的自我报告可以被认为是一种最低限度的内省，但缺乏意识体验。

Conclusion: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的自我报告行为，质疑其是否可以被视为内省的一种形式。研究表明，LLMs在某种程度上可以展示出类内省的行为，但这并不伴随有意识体验。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

Motivation: 在日常对话字幕翻译任务中，RLHF方法效果不佳。因此，需要改进训练方法以应对分布性偏移带来的问题。

Method: 引入对抗训练框架RIVAL，作为RM和LLM之间的最小最大游戏，迭代更新模型。RM用于区分强弱翻译，并结合定量偏好奖励（如BLEU）进行无参考质量建模。

Result: RIVAL框架通过大量实验证明提高了翻译的质量。

Conclusion: RIVAL改进了翻译基线的表现，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Motivation: 在社交媒体上检测自残对于早期干预和心理健康支持至关重要，但由于此类表达的微妙、依赖于上下文的性质，这一任务始终具有挑战性。识别自残意图有助于自杀预防，通过及时响应来实现，但当前的大型语言模型在理解日常语言和表情符号的隐含暗示上存在困难。

Method: 我们提供了一个统一的框架，包括：a）通过CESM-100丰富输入；b）微调LLMs以进行多任务学习：自残检测（主要任务）和CM/SI跨度检测（辅助任务）；c）为自残预测生成可解释的推理。

Conclusion: 我们的框架通过结合意图区分和上下文线索，显著提高了大语言模型LLMs在检测和解释任务中的性能，有效解决了自残信号中的固有模糊性。

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language

emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial

detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and

our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and

TL;DR: 该研究利用AI模型分析街道特征对商业表现影响，发现车辆活动、绿化和清洁度显著影响用户满意度和商店定价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中国城市中影响社区级街道商业活力的复杂因素尚未得到充分研究，了解这些因素有助于提升城市规划和商业发展。

Method: 该研究提出了一种基于图像的可解释框架，通过使用街景图像和多模态大型语言模型（VisualGLM-6B）分析街道特征，并结合美团和大众点评数据构建社区商业活力指数（CCVI），此外，还使用GPT-4进行空间属性的感知建模。

Result: 研究发现，适度的车辆存在可能提高商业访问性，但过度的街边停车会降低步行便利性，导致满意度和商店定价降低。较高的绿化和清洁度与满意度评分显著相关，但与定价的关联较弱。街道宽度调节车辆存在的影响，强调了空间配置的重要性。

Conclusion: 结合AI辅助感知与城市形态分析能够揭示商业成功的非线性和情境敏感驱动因素，强调了车辆活动在社区商业中的条件性角色，并展示多模态AI在城市诊断中的可行性。研究的影响涉及城市设计、停车管理和社区振兴规划工具的可扩展性。

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

TL;DR: 研究提出CL-ISR框架，将对比学习与隐式立场推理相结合，提高社交媒体误导文本检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台上的误导性文本会导致公众误解、社会恐慌甚至经济损失，因此在该领域进行研究具有重要意义。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的框架——CL-ISR，结合了对比学习和隐式立场推理的方法。对比学习通过构建正负样本对，增强模型识别真实与误导文本的能力；隐式立场推理模块用于探索文本中的潜在立场倾向及其与相关主题的关系。

Result: 新框架CL-ISR通过利用对比学习的辨识能力和隐式立场推理的解释深度，显著提高了误导性文本的检测效果。

Conclusion: 提出的CL-ISR框架能够显著提高社交媒体上误导性文本的检测准确性。

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管BERT和W2V能够捕捉到与口语能力相关的特征，但它们在各自的模式上存在局限性。为解决这些局限性，研究提出了一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 提议结合W2V和Phi-4多模态大语言模型，通过得分融合策略来提高评估效果。

Result: 提出的系统在Speak & Improve Challenge 2025官方测试集上取得了0.375的均方根误差（RMSE），在比赛中获得第二名。

Conclusion: 研究结合W2V和Phi-4多模态大语言模型，以得分融合策略改进口语能力评价，取得了良好效果。

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DiCoRe框架以解决零样本事件检测中的局限性，通过发散和收敛推理提高事件识别效果，实现了明显的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业领域内文档理解需要进行零样本事件检测，而复杂的事件本体理解、领域特定触发词的提取以及其结构化操作限制了大型语言模型在零样本事件检测中的效用。因此提出DiCoRe框架以解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一个名为DiCoRe的发散-收敛推理框架，通过Dreamer和Grounder将事件检测任务解耦，其中Dreamer进行发散推理以提升事件覆盖率，Grounder进行收敛推理以将自由预测与任务指令对齐，并通过有限状态机进行约束解码。

Result: DiCoRe在9个大型语言模型的基础上进行了广泛实验，通过发散和收敛推理框架提升了事件覆盖率和预测精度，实现了4-7%的F1得分提升。

Conclusion: DiCoRe作为一个强大的零样本事件检测框架，在多个数据集和领域中稳定超过了先前的零样本、迁移学习和推理基准，实现了4-7%的平均F1提升。

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

Motivation: 探讨神经语言模型的归纳偏差是否与人类处理约束一致，并寻找分析这些偏差的定量框架。

Method: 引入了一种信息论度量方法，m局部熵，通过平均有损上下文意外度来衡量语言的局部不确定性，并通过实验来研究其影响。

Result: 实验证明了具有高m局部熵的语言对Transformer和LSTM模型更难学习，表明神经语言模型对语言局部统计结构的敏感性。

Conclusion: 语言具有较高的m局部熵时，Transformer和LSTM语言模型学习难度增加，说明神经语言模型对语言的局部统计结构非常敏感。

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

Method: 通过在三种最先进的LALMs上应用词汇投影，追踪属性信息在层和标记位置上的演变。

Result: 我们的研究结果为听觉属性处理提供了见解，为未来的改进铺平了道路。

Conclusion: LALMs对音频输入的查询比在隐状态中聚合信息更依赖于预测属性。通过针对属性处理的分析方法，展示了一种增强LALMs的方法。

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

*Diege Sun,Guanyi Chen,Fan Zhao,Xiaorong Cheng,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with emulating human judgments on error severity, particularly in handling color and gender errors, with some bias evident in their assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can accurately replicate human judgment regarding the severity of errors in natural language generation, especially in terms of specific semantic errors.

Method: The study extends an experimental framework to compare human and LLM assessments specifically on image descriptions with semantic errors, examining these in both text-only and text+image contexts across four error types.

Result: The study finds that human judgments vary with error types, while LLMs show biases, particularly overrating color errors. Only DeepSeek-V3 showed high alignment with human judgment, surpassing other models, including multimodal ones.

Conclusion: LLMs, while effective in some tasks, may not consistently replicate human judgment, particularly in evaluating error severity in language generation. They exhibit biases and lack certain perceptual grounding inherent in humans.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

Motivation: 现有的RAG系统过于依赖检索到的上下文，可能导致对不准确来源的依赖，并忽略模型自身的知识，特别是在处理误导性或过多信息时。

Method: 提出了Knowledgeable-r1，使用联合采样并定义知识能力探索中的多策略分布，以刺激大语言模型对参数和上下文知识的自我整合利用。

Result: 实验表明，Knowledgeable-r1在参数和上下文冲突任务以及一般RAG任务中显著提高了鲁棒性和推理准确性，尤其是在反事实场景中比基线提高了17.07%。

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1有效地解决了RAG系统中过于依赖上下文的问题，通过更好地整合模型自身知识和检索知识，提高了任务表现。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型中的社会、人口和性别偏见如何结构性地表现，通过揭示这些偏见在模型内部的结构去进一步理解并可能减轻它们。

Method: 采用机理可解释性的方法，指出使用不同指标来识别模型内部负责偏见行为的边缘，并通过系统性消融展示偏见相关的计算集中于某些特定层。

Result: 确定了模型中结构表达偏见的组件种类，发现偏见相关的计算集中在少数层中，这些组件在微调设置中会变化，移除它们后减弱了偏见输出，但影响其他NLP任务。

Conclusion: 偏见相关的计算高度集中，通常集中在一小部分层中，移除这些组件可以减少偏见输出，但也会影响其他自然语言处理任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减少在 RAG（检索增强生成）过程中因较长的上下文而产生的开销，需要进行上下文压缩。然而，之前的压缩方法并未专注于剔除非证据性的信息，限制了基于 LLM 的 RAG 性能。

Method: 提出了一种称为 Evidentiality-guided RAG（ECoRAG）的框架，通过基于证据性的内容压缩改善 LLM 的性能。此法确保答案生成是由正确的证据支持的，并在证据不足时重新检索更多信息。

Result: ECoRAG 框架在开放域问答（ODQA）任务中提高了 LLM 的性能，通过仅保留生成正确答案所需的必要信息来减少延迟和最小化令牌使用，从而证明其高效性。

Conclusion: ECoRAG 框架在 ODQA 任务中提升了大型语言模型（LLM）的性能，相较之下优于现有的压缩方法，并在减少延迟和最小化令牌使用方面表现出相当高的成本效益。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

Result: 随着任务复杂性的增加，模型倾向于使用浅层启发式而不是遵循复杂指令。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的LLMs在处理更复杂的语法和样本时，性能接近于随机表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

*Adam Wiemerslage,Katharina von der Wense*

TL;DR: 研究了自监督辅助任务在极低数据情况下对形态屈折任务的作用，发现已知词素边界采样显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督目标在NLP中的进展是通过利用大规模未经标注的数据实现的，但对于许多语言来说，这些资源稀缺。少量数据有可能在字符级别任务中是有益的。

Method: 研究了用于形态屈折的自监督辅助任务对19种语言和13种辅助目标的效果，采用编码器-解码器转换器进行训练。

Result: 在未标记数据非常有限的情况下，自编码表现最佳；而随着数据可用性增加，字符掩码语言建模（CMLM）变得更有效。采用已知词素边界进行采样遮盖能一致地改善性能。

Conclusion: 自监督的辅助任务在极低资源环境下对形态变化（形态屈折）非常有效，而使用已知词素边界采样遮盖能够显著提升性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不连续结构的分析问题，并提供一个统一的自然语言结构表示方法。

Method: 采用短语结构语法、依存语法和范畴语法三种形式体系，通过统一的数学推导实现语言结构表示的整合。

Result: 连续表达和不连续结构都可以通过三种语法形式的综合表示和数学推导进行分析。

Conclusion: 本论文提出了一种统一的表示系统，可以同时处理自然语言结构中的连续性和不连续性。

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

TL;DR: 通过定义和实施一个三步推理过程，提高了幻觉检测的性能，验证了指导推理的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于蕴涵分类是一个复杂的推理任务，因此在幻觉检测中，引导大语言模型生成明确的推理过程可以提高其性能。

Method: 提出了一个三步推理过程：(i) 声明分解，(ii) 子声明归因和蕴涵分类，(iii) 聚合分类，并引入了一种分析方案来评估中间推理步骤的质量。

Result: 引导推理过程可以实现更精细和准确的蕴涵判断，这一方案的实施提供了额外的实证证据证明其优越性。

Conclusion: 通过引导模型进行系统且全面的推理过程，可以显著提高幻觉检测的准确性。

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

TL;DR: Micro-Act框架通过层次化细粒度比较解决了RAG系统中的知识冲突问题，在问答准确率上超过了现有方法，并在无冲突问题上也有良好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中知识冲突问题，避免LLMs被过量或冗长的上下文内容淹没，改善在问答任务中的表现。

Method: 提出了一种具有层次化行动空间的框架Micro-Act，通过自适应地分解知识源进行细粒度比较，从而超越表面上下文进行推理。

Result: 在五个基准数据集和三种类型的冲突（尤其是时间和语义类型）中，Micro-Act在问答准确率上均显著优于当前最先进的方法，并且在无冲突问题上表现稳健，突出了其实用价值。

Conclusion: Micro-Act展示了其在处理知识冲突方面的显著效果，并在无冲突问题上也稳定表现出色，增强了RAG在实际应用中的价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多个AI代理协作执行复杂任务时存在错误传播和次优性能的问题，主要由于提示设计不佳，因此需要一个解决此挑战的方法。

Method: 介绍了一种创新的推理时提示优化方法ProRefine，利用大语言模型的文本反馈动态优化提示，无需额外训练或真实标签。

Result: 在五个基准数学推理数据集上，与零样本链式思考基线相比，ProRefine的表现提升了3到37个百分点。

Conclusion: ProRefine显著提高了多步骤推理任务的准确性，使得小模型能够与大模型匹敌，显示出其在高效和可扩展的AI部署中的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过约束优化提高LLM遗忘能力的新方法，能够在去除敏感信息的同时保持良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遗忘方法在遗忘和保留之间存在不稳定的优化问题，特别是在激进的遗忘情况下，性能下降明显。需要更稳定且高效的方法来实现遗忘。

Method: 我们提出了一种将LLM遗忘问题视为约束优化问题的新方法，通过logit-margin flattening loss推动指定遗忘集合的输出分布达到均匀性，同时在单独的保留集合上施加硬性约束来保持信息。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试以及不同LLM架构上的评估表明，我们的方法能够有效地移除目标信息，同时保留下游应用的实用性，与现有顶尖基线相当或更好。

Conclusion: 我们的研究通过一种新的约束优化问题的方法改进了大型语言模型的遗忘能力，实现了更稳定、更高效的优化，并在保留数据方面保持了更好的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的搜索增强型语言模型分析数据集规模有限且范围狭窄，无法有效涵盖多样化意图和语言交互。因此，我们构建了一个大型数据集以支持更全面的分析和研究。

Method: 我们引入了一个名为“搜索舞台”的数据集，进行多种跨场景的分析，考察了用户在不同的搜索语言模型使用场景中的表现。此外，我们通过在人为偏好数据集上的实验来研究用户偏好受引用数量和来源影响的情况。

Result: 用户偏好受引用数量影响，而非仅受内容支持度的影响。不同来源的引用影响用户偏好，社区驱动平台更受欢迎。在非搜索环境中，搜索增强型模型的性能未下降，某些情况下还可能提升。而在搜索密集场景中，单靠模型原有知识性能会显著下降。

Conclusion: 搜索增强型语言模型能够结合网络搜索和大型语言模型，以提高响应的可靠性和时效性。尽管如此，使用现有的数据集进行这种系统的分析仍然具有挑战性。我们的研究引入了“搜索舞台”，这是一个基于人群调研的大规模人类偏好数据集，包含超过24,000对多轮用户与搜索增强型语言模型交互的数据。用户的偏好受引用数量影响，而不仅仅是引用内容的关联性，显示出用户感知和实际可信度之间的差距。使用不同引用源时，用户偏好也存在差异。开放的社区驱动平台通常更受欢迎，而静态百科类来源并不总是合适和可靠。此外，当在非搜索环境中测试搜索增强型模型时，网络搜索不会降低性能，在某些情况下甚至会提高性能，但在搜索密集环境中，性能受限于模型本身的知识时会显著下降。研究人员可以通过开放源码数据集进行进一步研究。

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

Motivation: 探讨语言模型在对齐和评估中的偏见问题，尤其是如何减少偏好模型的错误校准。

Method: 提出了一种基于反事实数据增强（CDA）的后训练方法，通过合成对比示例来微调模型。

Result: 使用CDA微调后，模型的错误校准从39.4%降低到32.5%，偏差平均绝对差异从20.5%降低到10.0%。

Conclusion: 通过CDA微调模型可以有效降低偏好模型的错误校准和偏差，同时保持整体性能。

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

Method: ProLoRA通过将源模型的低秩调整投射到目标模型的权重空间来实现知识迁移，利用子空间和零空间的相似性，并有选择性地对齐层进行调整。

Result: 在成熟的文本到图像模型上的评估显示，ProLoRA能够实现成功的知识迁移，并在无需重新训练的情况下获得与传统方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: ProLoRA方法成功在不进行重新训练的情况下实现了知识的迁移，并展示了与重新训练方法相当的性能。

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动化代理在用户决策中发挥越来越大的作用，确保情境完整性变得至关重要。

Method: 我们提出了一种强化学习框架，利用人工合成的数据集，通过对LLMs进行CI的推理训练，减少信息披露的不当性。

Result: 改进效果不仅局限于人工数据集，还能推广到已有的CI基准测试上，如PrivacyLens。

Conclusion: 我们的方法显著减少了不当信息披露，同时在多个模型大小和族群中保持了任务性能。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory

achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

Motivation: 在环境中训练大型语言模型（LLM）代理以获取必要技能并执行多样任务，以实现开放性不断为人们所关注。然而，为其技能获取创建训练数据集面临许多挑战。手动轨迹收集需要大量人力，而让LLM直接提出学习任务通常是无效的，因为LLM缺乏哪些任务实际可行的知识。此外，生成的数据可能无法提供有意义的学习信号，因为代理在所提出任务上通常已经表现良好。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的自动技能发现框架EXIF。该框架采用探索优先策略，通过探索代理Alice来训练目标代理Bob，使其在环境中学习基础技能。具体来说，Alice先与环境交互，以追溯方式生成可行的环境基础技能数据集，然后用于训练Bob。关键是我们引入了迭代反馈回路，Alice评估Bob的表现以识别需要改进的区域。这一反馈引导Alice进行下一轮探索，形成闭环数据生成过程。

Result: EXIF有效发现有意义的技能，并在没有任何人工干预的情况下迭代扩展训练代理的能力，实现了显著的性能提升。实验表明，在Webshop和Crafter上的应用中，EXIF能够显著增强训练代理的能力。设置Alice与Bob使用相同模型也显著提高了性能，展示了EXIF构建自我进化系统的潜力。

Conclusion: EXIF框架通过自动技能发现和迭代反馈机制，有效提升了LLM代理在环境中学习和执行任务的能力，展示了该框架构建自我进化系统的潜力。

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

*Jack David Carson,Amir Reisizadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个统计物理框架，利用漂移扩散系统捕捉推理动态，并通过实验验证这一模型的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的Transformer语言模型在推理方面表现出了一些难以理解的机制行为，亟需一个新的框架来解释这种推理动态。

Method: 我们提出了一种统计物理框架，将句子级别的隐藏状态轨迹建模为低维流形上的随机动态系统，以漂移扩散系统捕获不同的推理阶段。

Result: 通过对8个模型和7个基准进行的实验证明，使用秩为40的投影可以解释约50%的方差，并找到了四种潜在的推理状态。

Conclusion: 我们验证了一种SLDS模型，能够捕捉这些特征，并使得低成本推理模拟成为可能。

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

TL;DR: 引入了一个用于判定假设可行性的数据集，展示了当前模型的挑战和通过解决这些挑战来加速科学发现的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够基于可行性过滤假设的能力，使得发现系统可以大规模运行，并增加其做出重大发现的可能性。

Method: 引入了Matter-of-Fact挑战数据集，从科学文章中提取了8.4k条声明，涵盖超导体、半导体、电池和航空材料四个主题，包含理论、实验和代码/模拟结果中的定性和定量声明。

Result: 尽管使用检索增强生成的强基线无法超过72%的表现（随机表现为50%），但领域专家验证建议几乎所有问题都是可解决的。

Conclusion: 尽管目前的模型较难解决这个问题，但如果在这一领域取得进展，可能会显著加速科学发现。

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂的多表情境下表现不佳，困难在于跨多个复杂表进行可靠的模式链接。

Method: 我们提出了一种图结构框架，利用人工策划的关系知识显式编码模式链接和连接路径。通过修剪和子路径合并策略进行效率提升和一致性改善。

Result: 实验结果表明，无论是在标准基准还是大规模真实数据集上，我们的方法都展示了有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的方法能够处理复杂的工业表数据，多表问答表现优异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于排名的AI异常检测监控系统，在公共卫生数据监控中效率提高了54倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共卫生专家需要可扩展的方法来监控大量的健康数据，以及时发现疫情爆发或数据质量问题。传统的基于警报的监控系统由于警报阈值需要不断重设和数据量可能导致应用延迟等原因，难以适应现代公共卫生数据监控系统的需求。

Method: 提出了一种基于排名的监控范式，利用新的人工智能异常检测方法，通过多年的跨学科合作研发，已在一个国家组织中部署，日监控数据点可达500万。

Result: 在一项为期三个月的纵向部署评估中，结果显示相较于传统的基于警报的方法，审查速度效率提高了54倍，有效改善了监控目标。

Conclusion: 这项工作突显了以人为中心的人工智能在转变公共卫生决策中的潜力。

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential
of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

TL;DR: 研究表明，当今的大型语言模型在处理匹配市场中的复杂偏好问题上表现有限，特别是在大规模实例中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理匹配市场等组合领域中排序偏好和结构算法的能力仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 评估多种先进模型在从稳定匹配生成到不稳定检测、解决以及细化偏好查询等一系列偏好推理任务中的表现，以此揭示其在处理排序输入时的逻辑和算法限制。

Result: 即使是表现最好的模型在大规模市场中仍难以解决不稳定性，常常无法识别阻塞对或迭代执行算法。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的语言模型在处理大规模市场的不稳定性时仍存在明显的局限性，尽管在小规模市场中通过参数高效微调（LoRA）可以显著改善性能。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

*Jiayu Liu,Zhenya Huang,Wei Dai,Cheng Cheng,Jinze Wu,Jing Sha,Song Li,Qi Liu,Shijin Wang,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogMath, a new framework, assesses LLMs' math skills via human cognition-inspired stages and reveals a 30%-40% overestimation of their capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation paradigms for LLMs focus only on overall answer accuracy, not fully capturing their complex mathematical reasoning abilities. A more detailed assessment approach is needed to understand their capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces CogMath, a framework inspired by psychological theories that evaluates LLMs through three reasoning stages: problem comprehension, problem solving, and solution summarization. Within these stages, 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions are used. A multi-agent system, 'Inquiry-Judge-Reference', is employed for evaluation.

Result: Application of CogMath to three benchmarks shows that the mathematical capabilities of seven mainstream LLMs have been overestimated by 30%-40%. It highlights specific areas of strength and weakness in these models, providing guidance for future enhancements.

Conclusion: CogMath reveals that the mathematical capabilities of current LLMs are overestimated by 30%-40%, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STPR framework uses LLMs to convert complex natural language constraints into Python functions for robotic navigation, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the difficulty of translating informal, complex constraints from natural language into formal, executable descriptions for robotic navigation planning.

Method: STPR utilizes large language models (LLMs) to convert constraints given in natural language into Python code, avoiding complex logical reasoning and potential errors like hallucinations.

Result: Experiments show that STPR can successfully translate constraints into code with high accuracy, ensuring compliance and efficiency in various scenarios. It is also effective with smaller, code-specific LLMs, enabling application with low-cost models.

Conclusion: STPR framework demonstrates effective translation of natural language constraints into executable Python functions, maintaining compliance and efficiency in a simulated environment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

TL;DR: The paper presents automatic schema generation using large language models, demonstrating their capability in generating high-quality schemas for large knowledge graphs using ShEx sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the substantial involvement needed from knowledge engineers and domain experts in schema generation by leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

Method: The paper introduces LLM-based pipelines that utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs to automatically generate schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx).

Result: Experiments validate that LLMs can effectively generate high-quality ShEx schemas, suitable for large knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for producing high-quality Shape Expressions (ShEx) schemas for large knowledge graphs, enabling automated schema generation.

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured
generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的农业智能系统在语境理解、可解释性和适应性方面存在不足，尤其是在面向资源有限的小农户时。大型语言模型缺乏具体领域知识和语境推理，因此需要开发更适合农业场景的智能框架。

Method: OpenAg结合了领域专用基础模型、神经知识图谱、多代理推理、因果解释以及适应性迁移学习，以提供具有语境意识、可解释且可执行的洞察。

Conclusion: OpenAg旨在通过农业人工通用智能框架，提供具有语境理解、可解释性和适应性强的解决方案，以填补科学知识与农民经验之间的空白。

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

Motivation: 尽管基于深度神经网络的方法在科学计算中的偏微分方程求解中变得流行，但与传统数值方法相比，这些方法通常缺乏收敛性保证和计算效率。

Method: DeePoly将解决方案范式从纯粹的非凸参数优化转化为一个两阶段方法：首先使用DNN捕获复杂的全局特征，然后通过线性空间优化结合DNN提取的特征和多项式基函数进行优化。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，该方法在不同问题类型上显著增强了高阶精度和效率。

Conclusion: DeePoly大大提高了高阶精度和效率，同时保持了无网格和无方案属性。

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图形用户界面（GUI）自动化的在线交互环境要求逐步决策并实时状态，容错率低，错误可能导致不可逆的结果。

Method: 引入了预操作批判机制，通过推理操作结果和正确性来提供反馈，提出了一个带有建议奖励的新策略S-GRPO来构建我们的模型GUI-Critic-R1。

Result: 静态实验和动态评估表明在不同领域，GUI-Critic-R1在批判准确性、成功率和操作效率上都表现优越。

Conclusion: GUI-Critic-R1的批判准确性和战绩优于当前的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），在动态评估中成功率和操作效率更高。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

Motivation: 在法律领域中，推理能力是法律实践的核心部分。尽管已有多个法律数据集，但针对推理任务的专门研究尚属罕见。

Method: 引入CHANCERY公司治理推理基准，用于测试模型在公司治理法律下的推理能力。基准由企业章程和高管行动提案组成，任务是二元分类判断提案是否符合章程规则。

Result: 顶尖推理模型在CHANCERY基准上的表现具有挑战性，其中Claude 3.7 Sonnet和GPT-4o的准确率分别为64.5%和75.2%。而基于ReAct和CodeAct框架的推理代理分别达到了76.1%和78.1%的准确率。

Conclusion: 本文提出的CHANCERY基准测试了模型在公司治理推理中的表现，研究显示现有模型在此类任务中仍需显著提高。

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

TL;DR: 提出了利用大型语言模型提取电动自行车事故报告中的安全变量，分析事故严重性与因素之间的关系，并取得了优异的分类准确性，助力于提升电动自行车的安全分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动自行车使用的快速增加，事故报告也随之增加，因此带来了安全隐患。本研究旨在解决传统事故报告形式缺乏结构化数据的问题，从而阻碍数量性的安全分析。

Method: 研究使用了一个由四个大型语言模型代理组成的框架来处理数据分类、信息提取、伤害原因确定和组件关联等任务，并采用有序逻辑回归模型来分析事故严重性与检索因素之间的关系。

Result: 研究发现设备问题略多于人为问题，但人为因素导致的事故更具致命性。具体而言，踏板、轮胎和刹车是事故的常见贡献因素。模型在分类准确性方面实现了0.87的加权F1分数。

Conclusion: 研究展示了大型语言模型在安全数据提取方面的潜力，为政策制定者、设计师和监管机构提供了可操作的信息，从而提高了电动自行车的安全性分析。

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to
accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in
classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract
unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a
scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable
information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

Conclusion: 本文通过引入大型语言模型（LLMs）在模拟大规模多人在线游戏（MMO）经济中具有有效性。

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research,
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game
economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced
by reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, existing works encounter significant
challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among
agents, particularly regarding agent reliability, sociability, and
interpretability. In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a
novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation.
Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning
aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and
adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing,
perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges
effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities
demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role
specialization and price fluctuations in line with market rules.

TL;DR: 研究分析了强化学习如何影响语言模型的推理能力，发现RL对模型的稳健性和知识整合能力有积极作用，为今后的推理模型训练和评估提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于强化学习的训练方法如GRPO表现出显著的经验收益，但其优势的细粒度理解仍然不足，因此该研究引入细粒度分析框架以剖析RL对推理的影响。

Method: 引入了一个细粒度的分析框架，以解剖强化学习对推理的影响，并研究几个关键元素。使用此框架，通过性能比较分析，观察RL训练模型在面对挑战性基准测试时的表现。

Result: 发现RL调整的模型在性能下降方面比基础模型更具稳健性；强化学习增强了模型把知识整合到推理过程中的能力，从而在多种任务中提高了表现。研究表明开发新的方法以利用难题能够改善训练。

Conclusion: 强化学习可能并没有主要提升模型执行外部计划的能力，而是增强了它们制定和遵循更适合其推理过程的内部策略的能力。此外，强化学习提高了模型整合已提供知识到其推理过程中的能力，提升了各种任务的表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant

conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

Conclusion: 新的模型为基础的强化学习框架能同时优化任务表现和安全性，并在多种安全关键的连续控制任务中表现优异，超过现有方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

Method: 首先，基于代理、环境和目标的文本描述，生成控制策略，然后通过在评估中收集的性能反馈和感知-运动数据，不断提示模型改进当前策略。

Result: 在Gymnasium和MuJoCo库的经典控制任务中，成功识别出最佳或高性能解决方案。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够通过直接映射连续的观测向量到连续的动作向量来控制具身代理。

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

Result: 在检测方面取得了89%的准确率，并通过激活引导成功实现了40%的适合情境的欺骗发生率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了推理模型中的特定诚实问题，为可信赖的AI对齐提供了工具。

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Conclusion: 本文首次成功地将可微分逻辑门网络应用于递归结构中，实现了高效的目标模式生成和模式学习。

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

Method: 提出了RAG-UAV，一个通过检索增强生成的框架，该框架通过提供相关领域文献来改善LLMs在UAV特定背景下的数学推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，通过应用RAG框架，LLMs准确回答问题的能力显著提高（最高可达75%准确率），错误公式选择率降低（从25%降到5%），数值误差也大幅减少，模型的均方误差降低几个量级。

Conclusion: RAG框架能够有效增强LLMs在UAV情境下的数学推理能力，显著提高了问题解答的准确性，并减少了错误公式选择和数值误差。尽管在飞行控制使用上还需进一步探讨和验证，这项研究表明RAG对LLMs在工程分析中的应用具有潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

Motivation: 当前的自我改进代理面临的两个核心限制：自我改进过程常常僵化，难以在任务领域之间泛化，并且随着代理能力的增加难以扩展。

Method: 介绍一种包括三个组成部分的正式框架：元认知知识、元认知计划和元认知评估。

Result: 分析现有自我改进代理，发现它们主要依赖外源性元认知机制，这限制了可扩展性和适应性。

Conclusion: 需要在人类和代理之间合理分配元认知责任，并稳健地评估和改进内源性元认知学习，以实现真正的持续、泛化和一致的自我改进。

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

Motivation: 现有方法的固定探索超参数限制了在不同任务中的适应性，因此提出一种更灵活且上下文敏感的搜索方法。

Method: 提出了 LLM 自我引导搜索的方法，通过 LLM 内部评分机制自我决策搜索路径。

Result: LFS 通过对 Countdown 和 Sudoku 的测试，展示出更高效的计算能力和更好的性能，尤其是在使用强大模型时。

Conclusion: LLM-First Search (LFS) 方法优于传统搜索算法，特别是在处理更具挑战性的任务时。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型在处理简单任务时浪费了大量计算资源，因此需要一种更聪明的方式来根据问题难度分配计算资源。

Method: 引入一种自适应长度惩罚（ALP）的强化学习目标函数，根据每个提示的在线解决率来调整生成长度。通过多次rollouts监控提示的解决率，并添加一个可微惩罚，其大小与解决率成反比。

Result: 在应用ALP后，DeepScaleR-1.5B实现了平均令牌使用的50％减少，同时在最困难的问题上提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 通过应用自适应长度惩罚（ALP），可以在不显著降低性能的情况下，将平均令牌使用量减少50％，从而更智能地分配计算预算。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多智能体系统框架普遍缺乏灵活性、资源意识、模型多样性以及自主工具创建能力。

Method: 引入了一个“CEO”代理来动态管理基于任务需求和资源约束（如成本和内存）的专业“员工”代理，采用混合智能方法，优先使用较小的本地LLMs（通过Ollama），在必要时灵活使用外部API和更大的模型。

Result: 评估结果显示：在学术论文审查任务中成功率为58%；在安全评估任务中，在JailbreakBench子集上成功率为100%；在复杂推理任务中，超越了Gemini 2.0 Flash，在GSM8K上为96%对61%；JEEBench为80%对68.3%；SVAMP为92%对84%。

Conclusion: HASHIRU提供了一种通过动态层级控制、资源感知的混合智能和自主功能扩展以实现更稳健、效率更高且适应性更强的多智能体系统的方法。

Abstract: Rapid Large Language Model (LLM) advancements are fueling autonomous
Multi-Agent System (MAS) development. However, current frameworks often lack
flexibility, resource awareness, model diversity, and autonomous tool creation.
This paper introduces HASHIRU (Hierarchical Agent System for Hybrid Intelligent
Resource Utilization), a novel MAS framework enhancing flexibility, resource
efficiency, and adaptability. HASHIRU features a "CEO" agent dynamically
managing specialized "employee" agents, instantiated based on task needs and
resource constraints (cost, memory). Its hybrid intelligence prioritizes
smaller, local LLMs (via Ollama) while flexibly using external APIs and larger
models when necessary. An economic model with hiring/firing costs promotes team
stability and efficient resource allocation. The system also includes
autonomous API tool creation and a memory function. Evaluations on tasks like
academic paper review (58% success), safety assessments (100% on a
JailbreakBench subset), and complex reasoning (outperforming Gemini 2.0 Flash
on GSM8K: 96% vs. 61%; JEEBench: 80% vs. 68.3%; SVAMP: 92% vs. 84%) demonstrate
HASHIRU's capabilities. Case studies illustrate its self-improvement via
autonomous cost model generation, tool integration, and budget management.
HASHIRU offers a promising approach for more robust, efficient, and adaptable
MAS through dynamic hierarchical control, resource-aware hybrid intelligence,
and autonomous functional extension. Source code and benchmarks are available
at https://github.com/HASHIRU-AI/HASHIRU and

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

Conclusion: HoAs-PALN算法在动态灾后环境中表现出色，大幅提高了任务完成率，并显著减少了在线调度时间。

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

Motivation: 解决独立模型在处理需要记忆、推理、实时定位和多模态理解的任务中存在的局限性。

Method: 定义CAIS概念，提出基于组件角色和协调策略的多维分类法，分析四种基础范式：检索增强生成（RAG）、LLM代理、多模态LLM（MLLMs）以及以协调为中心的架构。

Result: 审查代表性系统，比较设计权衡，总结这些范式中的评价方法。识别关键挑战，并阐述未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 提供一个全面的基础，以帮助理解、开发和推进下一代系统级人工智能。

Abstract: Compound Al Systems (CAIS) is an emerging paradigm that integrates large
language models (LLMs) with external components, such as retrievers, agents,
tools, and orchestrators, to overcome the limitations of standalone models in
tasks requiring memory, reasoning, real-time grounding, and multimodal
understanding. These systems enable more capable and context-aware behaviors by
composing multiple specialized modules into cohesive workflows. Despite growing
adoption in both academia and industry, the CAIS landscape remains fragmented,
lacking a unified framework for analysis, taxonomy, and evaluation. In this
survey, we define the concept of CAIS, propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy
based on component roles and orchestration strategies, and analyze four
foundational paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM Agents,
Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), and orchestration-centric architectures. We review
representative systems, compare design trade-offs, and summarize evaluation
methodologies across these paradigms. Finally, we identify key
challenges-including scalability, interoperability, benchmarking, and
coordination-and outline promising directions for future research. This survey
aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive foundation
for understanding, developing, and advancing the next generation of
system-level artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: 通过自然语言增强多代理学习提高学习效果和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多代理强化学习中的通信通常效率低或不可解释。受自然智能中语言作用启发，研究将人类定义的语言应用于多代理的学习和协调。

Method: 提出一个框架，代理不仅通过行为进行训练，还通过自然语言描述进行训练。这种语言增强学习能让代理进行显式通信和指导表示学习。

Result: 证明用该方法训练的代理在各种任务中优于传统的通信基线方法，语言落地使代理有更信息量的内部表示，更好地泛化到新的伙伴，以及改进的人机互动能力。

Conclusion: 将结构化语言整合到多代理学习中提高了可解释性和能力。

Abstract: Communication is a fundamental aspect of coordinated behavior in multi-agent
reinforcement learning. Yet, most prior works in this field have focused on
emergent communication protocols developed from scratch, often resulting in
inefficient or non-interpretable systems. Inspired by the role of language in
natural intelligence, we investigate how grounding agents in a human-defined
language can improve learning and coordination of multiple embodied agents. We
propose a framework in which agents are trained not only to act but also to
produce and interpret natural language descriptions of their observations. This
language-augmented learning serves a dual role: enabling explicit communication
between agents and guiding representation learning. We demonstrate that agents
trained with our method outperform traditional emergent communication baselines
across various tasks. Our analysis reveals that language grounding leads to
more informative internal representations, better generalization to new
partners, and improved capability for human-agent interaction. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating structured language into
multi-agent learning and open avenues for more interpretable and capable
multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs主要用于同步通信中，然而许多现实设置实际上是异步的，因此需要发展一种能在异步环境下自适应地参与交流的LLM系统。

Method: 研究者开发了一种自适应异步LLM代理，该代理能决定何时发言，并通过一个在线Mafia游戏的数据集进行评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，开发的异步代理不仅在游戏表现上能与人类玩家媲美，并且在何时发言的决策上具有人类相似的模式，尽管在信息内容上存在差异。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了异步LLM代理在真实多人场景中的应用潜力，表明了其融入复杂社交动态的可能性。

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

Conclusion: 扩散模型通过梯度漂移可达到稳定，及记忆和生成之间的转变。

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

Conclusion: 通过实验证明，MLNs可以显著提高现有的OOD检测器的性能，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该工作确立了使用transformer架构应用于材料科学问题的可行性，展示数据驱动方法在革命性改变结构行为预测和工程设计实践中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while
maintaining topic relevance.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

### [145] [MUC-G4: Minimal Unsat Core-Guided Incremental Verification for Deep Neural Network Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04268)
*Jingyang Li,Guoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的增量验证框架MUC-G4，用于高效验证压缩的深度神经网络，解决了现有方法在结构变化方面的不足。实验表明该方法在处理量化和剪枝时效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习的发展使得神经网络在边缘设备上的部署面临挑战，主要由于其高内存和运行时复杂性。现有的增量验证方法主要关注量化，而在处理结构变化时表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种新的增量验证框架MUC-G4，将原始和压缩网络编码为SMT公式，分类更改，并使用原始网络的最小不可满足核心（MUCs）指导对压缩网络的高效验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，MUC-G4在处理量化和剪枝方面表现有效，证明重用率高，验证时间相比传统方法显著加快。

Conclusion: MUC-G4为压缩神经网络的安全性和可靠性提供了一个有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

Abstract: We study the role of the sampling distribution in Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and aim to understand its impact on DPO's training dynamics.
Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework
in practice.

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

TL;DR: DrSR通过结合数据理解和生成反思提升了符号回归的能力，在方程发现上具有潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM-SR方法过度依赖内在先验，缺乏对数据的显式理解和系统反思。

Method: DrSR框架结合数据驱动的洞察和反思学习，指导LLMs分析数据中的结构关系，并建立反馈循环以优化方程生成。

Result: 实验证明DrSR在多个跨学科数据集上表现优异，在有效方程率和性能方面均超过其他方法。

Conclusion: DrSR显著提高了有效方程的生成率，并且在准确性、泛化性和搜索效率方面优于传统和基于LLM的方法。

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

Motivation: 为了减小数据下行传输的瓶颈，通过卫星在轨处理部分数据并优先级下传重要数据。

Method: 使用物理感知神经形态网络（PANN），通过纳米电子电路元件“忆阻器”来监测多光谱卫星图像的变化从而生成变化图。权重会根据输入信号变化，通过忆阻器状态方程和电路守恒定律动态更新，生成物理约束的动态输出特征，以距离度量方式检测变化。

Conclusion: PANN是一种无训练的，有效的解决低地球轨道卫星资源受限的在轨处理问题的方法，在自然灾害检测任务中与现有的AI模型相比取得了更好的效果。

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

Motivation: 适应技术虽然提高了大型骨干模型的训练效率，但有限的适应数据仍然造成挑战。作者通过利用用于预训练骨干模型的海量数据来解决这一问题。

Result: ALBAT提升了在数据稀缺情况下的适应训练，尤其是在个性化和语言生成任务中表现显著。

Conclusion: 引入ALBAT算法可以在个性化和语言生成任务中有效提升适应训练，即使数据稀缺。

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

Motivation: 在社会决策中，机器学习发挥着重要作用，尤其是需要考虑被分类代理如何对学习算法作出反应。过去的研究主要集中于减少和抵制代理的欺骗行为，而新的研究发现代理在取得理想分类时的真正改进会产生意想不到的可学习性特性。

Conclusion: 研究结果解决了Attias等人提出的关于正当和不正当的学习问题，并提出了一种在可实现和不可知在线学习中取得更低泛化误差的新方法。

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

TL;DR: 探讨Transformer在不同学习机制中的关系推理任务表现，发现预训练有助于其上下文推理能力发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer如何在不同的学习机制下进行关系推理，特别是心理学中经典的传递推理任务。

Method: 比较两种不同的学习机制：权重学习（IWL）和上下文学习（ICL），通过分别训练和分析模型的行为和机制。

Result: 发现权重学习自然促进传递推理的泛化，而未能在上下文学习中实现。通过预训练上下文线性回归任务，Transformer能够实现上下文内的可泛化传递推理。

Conclusion: 预训练具有结构的任务可促进模型发展能支持上下文关系推理的表征。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

Conclusion: 本文提出的LDPTRLQ算法在兼顾Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty贪婪优化和强化学习长期视角方面具有理论上的优越性，并在模拟测试中表现出色。

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

Result: 实验结果表明，AutoCT在有限的自我优化迭代中，能够在临床试验预测任务上与或超过现有最先进方法（SOTA）。

Conclusion: AutoCT为可扩展、可解释且成本有效的临床试验预测建立了新的范式。

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of
interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use
in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel
framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models
with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously
generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information
without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively
optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs
on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks
within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new
paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial
prediction.

forecasting strategies for different consumer groups and demonstrating the
impact of incorporating detailed weather data on forecasting accuracy. These
advancements contribute to more reliable power demand predictions, thereby

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to
Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency
metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management
under dynamically uncertain conditions.

Motivation: 为了提高下一代集成学习系统的稳定性和可靠性，本文提出了一种增强方法。

Result: 通过使用softlog-softmax级联技术，可以在复杂问题上显著提高集成学习系统的多样性和一致性。

Conclusion: 采用softlog-softmax技术的多步骤过程能够提高集成学习系统的表现。

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于RFT的红队方法缺乏统一的基准，不同实现细节特别是在PPO基础上的RFT影响结果稳定性和可重现性。

Method: 引入了RedRFT，该基准结合了CleanRL的单文件设计优势和Tianshou的模块化特性，提供了高质量的红队实现和模块化的PPO核心组件。还实施了一项关键组件的消融研究。

Conclusion: RedRFT作为一个轻量级的基准，可简化和标准化基于RFT的红队方法的实现和评估，促进创新特性的快速原型设计。

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features
for RFT-based red teaming. Code for the benchmark can be accessed at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: YOTO方法通过一次训练实现损失权重超参数的自动优化，并在计算机视觉任务中优于传统网格搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 限制模型训练过程中损失选择和权重调整的次次数，将训练次数减少至一次。

Method: 通过标准的基于梯度的优化方法，将损失权重的超参数视为网络的常规参数进行学习。使用一种参数化为softmax操作的创新层以确保损失超参数的正值约束。

Result: 与最先进的暴力网格搜索方法相比，YOTO在计算机视觉中的3D估计和语义分割任务中展示了一次训练的优越性能。

Conclusion: YOTO方法在同一训练过程中可以有效地自动优化损失权重的超参数，并在与现有技术的对比中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

Motivation: 开发一种方法，在减少参数的同时保持合理的准确度，通过使用随机连接的正则化效果，提高深度网络的性能。

Method: 使用半层隐藏单元，其中部分权重随机设置，部分可训练。每个隐藏单元具有两个可修改权重，与输入的加权和进行计算并通过非线性函数。

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上的实验表明，半层隐藏单元具有良好的效果，能减少参数数量并保持准确度。

Conclusion: 半层隐藏单元可以在深度网络中使用，通过随机连接的正则化效果，在参数减少的情况下实现合理的准确度。

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

<details>

Motivation: 在连续学习中，随着新任务的引入，对先前学习任务的性能会下降，即遗忘问题需要解决。样本重放被用来减缓遗忘。

Method: 本文提供了在超参数化的连续线性回归设置中样本重放的理论分析，并通过实验验证了神经网络中的类似行为。

Result: 实验表明，重放的性能高度依赖于选择重放样本的方式及任务之间的关系，在某些情况下，重放会增加遗忘。

Conclusion: 即使在噪声不存在的情况下，样本重放可能会导致非单调的遗忘行为。在某些情况下，重放反而可能有害。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

### [165] [Bridging the Performance Gap Between Target-Free and Target-Based Reinforcement Learning With Iterated Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04398)
*Théo Vincent,Yogesh Tripathi,Tim Faust,Yaniv Oren,Jan Peters,Carlo D'Eramo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: iS-QL provides a scalable RL method that balances the benefits of target-free and target-based methods, enhancing performance and efficiency with reduced memory use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve reinforcement learning by removing the target network to reallocate memory and increase online network capacity while tackling instability issues that come with removing the target network.

Method: The paper proposes iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), which uses a copy of the last linear layer of the online network as a target network while sharing other parameters with the online network, enabling concurrent learning of Bellman iterations.

Result: iS-QL reduces the performance gap between target-free and target-based approaches, using less memory and comparable training time, thus improving scalability.

Conclusion: iS-QL improves sample efficiency in target-free approaches while maintaining or reducing memory requirements and training time compared to classical target-based algorithms.

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

Motivation: 在元测试阶段缺乏奖励信号的情况下，提高样本效率，并减少元训练中的样本需求。

Method: 提出了一种称为无监督元测试的条件神经过程（UMCNP）的方法，将参数化策略梯度和任务推断型元强化学习相结合，并利用条件神经过程的效率和可扩展性来减少元测试中所需的在线交互次数。

Result: UMCNP方法能够在元测试阶段利用显著比基线更少的样本适应未见过的测试任务。

Conclusion: UMCNP通过在元测试期间高效地使用样本，成功实现了在缺乏奖励信号的情况下对任务的自适应，从而提高了元强化学习的样本效率。

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

Motivation: 填补自监督对比学习在理论基础上的空白，寻找CL目标的隐式监督式变体和其在多类情况下的损失表现。

Method: 证明对比学习（CL）目标的损失函数在类别数增加时能有效近似NSCL损失，通过引入新误差界探索特征变异性对少数样本分类性能的影响，并进行多种实验验证。

Result: 证明CL和NSCL损失差距随类别数增加而缩小，并推出少数样本误差的新界限，通过实验证实理论发现。

Conclusion: 通过理论推导和实验证明对比学习(CL)目标能有效近似一种称为仅负样本监督式对比损失(NSCL)的变体。随语义类别数增加，CL与NSCL损失之间的差距消失，且二者有高度相关性。通过CL损失的最小化，可实现高效几次样本分类准确性。

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

Conclusion: KOALA++在各种任务中（包括图像分类和语言建模）与最先进的一阶和二阶优化器的准确性相当或更好，同时保持了一阶方法的效率。

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络中的grokking现象，尤其是训练过程中的反grokking阶段，以提高对过拟合和泛化能力崩溃的理解。

Method: 使用3层MLP在MNIST的一千个样本子集上进行训练，应用开源工具WeightWatcher来跟踪重尾自正则化(HTSR)的层质量指标α参数。

Result: 发现了反grokking阶段，通过检测α参数小于2和相关性陷阱的出现来识别，可以在不直接访问测试数据的情况下评估过拟合和泛化能力崩溃。

Conclusion: 研究证明HTSR α参数是检测和区分grokking阶段的有效工具，并可作为泛化能力的衡量标准。

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

Result: RSF实现了60.0%的top-1准确率，比以前的方法提高了20%，同时FK引导在top-5往返准确率上比之前的方法提高了19%。

Conclusion: RSF通过离散流匹配和FK引导提高了单步逆合成的多样性和准确性，超越了现有的模板无关方法。

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

Conclusion: 选择性匹配损失函数在有重要分数区域的应用中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Motivation: 网络入侵检测系统 (NIDS) 在保护数字基础设施免受复杂网络威胁方面具有重要作用。然而，目前的模型在鲁棒性、可解释性和泛化性方面仍存在不足。作者希望通过扩展ODXU，结合深度嵌入聚类、符号推理和综合不确定性量化，提升NIDS的表现。

Method: 作者扩展了一种名为ODXU的神经符号AI框架，通过结合深度嵌入聚类进行特征提取，使用XGBoost进行符号推理，并通过综合不确定性量化增强系统的鲁棒性、可解释性和泛化能力。此外，还开发了一种转移学习策略，以便在不同的数据集上重用预训练的ODXU模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，ODXU在CIC-IDS-2017数据集上的六个评估指标中优于传统的神经网络模型。转移学习策略使得仅使用16,000个样本（约占训练数据的50%）就可以优于传统神经网络模型。此外，元模型UQ方法在两个数据集上均优于分数基础方法。

Conclusion: 该研究成功扩展了ODXU框架，并证明了其在网络安全中的潜力。通过结合深度嵌入聚类、符号推理和不确定性量化，增强了NIDS的性能。转移学习策略的开发进一步提高了模型在不同数据集上的适用性和效率。

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

Motivation: 系统性是机器学习模型中的一个核心方面，因为它有助于在新的上下文中实现强大的泛化能力。这引发了许多研究，提出了评估系统泛化的基准，以及设计用于增强系统性的模型和训练方案。

Method: 基于Hadley的系统泛化分类学，分析语言和视觉领域文献中的关键基准测试如何测评行为系统性，并强调评估机器学习模型中的表征系统性的方法，特别是在机械解释性领域的实践。

Result: 阐明表征系统性与行为系统性之间的区别，并分析关键基准测试在测试行为系统性方面的效果。强调了评估机器学习模型中表征系统性的重要性和方法。

Conclusion: 在机器学习模型中，仅仅关注行为系统性是不够的，研究需要深化到表征系统性的评估，以便推动这一领域的发展。

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service
(FFS), Geographic Managed Care, and Pre-Paid Health Plans. Providers were
categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine
learning techniques, particularly ensemble and deep learning models,
significantly enhance dental workforce classification. Their integration into
healthcare analytics can improve provider identification and resource
distribution, benefiting underserved populations.

TL;DR: 研究提出了COSMOS框架，能够在减少高达98.71%的计算成本的同时，高效预测语言模型适应情况的性能和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于在有资源限制的情况下选择模型和其适应策略非常具有挑战性，且往往需要进行大量的试验，该研究的动机是调查在不进行昂贵试验的情况下，是否可以准确预测性能和成本。

Method: 该研究通过一种统一的预测框架COSMOS来估算适应的结果，具体采用了增强嵌入的轻量代理模型预测微调性能，以及利用低样本扩展法则预测检索增强的上下文学习性能。

Result: COSMOS框架在八个具有代表性的基准测试中表现出高预测精度，同时平均减少了92.72%的计算成本，在资源密集型场景下甚至可减少到98.71%。

Conclusion: 通过引入COSMOS框架，该研究展示了在不进行昂贵试验的情况下，可以高效地预测语言模型的适应性能和成本，同时减少计算开销。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

TL;DR: 正交化梯度训练改善模型校准且不影响准确性，适用于多种优化器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型在校准度与精度间的权衡问题。

Method: 引入一种称为$\perp$Grad的正交化梯度训练方法，并证明其在简单假设下的收敛性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10的数据集上，$\perp$Grad方法在保持精度的同时显著改善了校准指标。在数据输入受损和延长训练的情况下，$\perp$Grad训练的模型相比传统SGD更稳定。

Conclusion: 使用正交化梯度在训练期间能改善模型校准而不损失精度。

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的蛋白质结构预测模型难以捕捉生物分子复合物的多样性，而cryo-EM尽管能够成像结构异质性，但处理流程复杂。为此，作者开发了一种新方法桥接两者，通过结合多种技术来生成符合生物多样性实验数据的模型。

Method: 开发了一种名为CryoBoltz的方法，该方法结合了预训练的蛋白质结构预测模型和全球及局部的结构约束，利用cryo-EM密度图引导模型在推理时的采样轨迹。

Result: CryoBoltz方法成功生成了多种动态生物分子系统（如转运蛋白和抗体）的异质cryo-EM图的原子模型。

Conclusion: 通过整合蛋白质结构预测模型和cryo-EM密度图，CryoBoltz方法能够有效指导结构预测模型采样轨迹，生成符合实验数据的构象状态。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的扰动梯度训练方法PGT，用于解决物理储层计算中不能反向传播的问题，通过随机扰动近似梯度更新，在多个架构和硬件中验证了性能优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物理储层计算中由于其黑箱性质无法实现反向传播的关键缺陷。

Method: 在物理储层中使用随机扰动策略，通过网络参数空间的前向传递，近似实现梯度更新，从而避开黑箱化的物理储层无法进行反向传播的问题。

Result: 在模拟的神经网络架构（如密集网络和带有储层层的Transformer模型）及实验硬件（如磁自振荡环）上验证了这一方法的可行性，且在无法进行反向传播的情况下表现出与标准反向传播方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: PGT表明即使在不能进行反向传播的情况下，也可以通过一种类似于随机扰动的方法实现与标准反向传播相当的性能。这为将物理储层集成到更深的神经网络架构中开辟了可能性，并在AI训练中实现了显著的能量效率提升。

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense
network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental
hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Motivation: 神经PDE求解器在建模复杂动态系统时具有强大能力，但在长时间跨度上易出现误差累积，以及难以维持稳定性和物理一致性。

Method: 提出了一种多尺度隐式神经模拟器，通过利用低维未来状态表示的层次结构，提高长期预测精度。灵感来源于数值隐式时间步进方法的稳定性，通过预测多个时间步长，并在每个时间步长点进行再细化，调整时间下采样率，以捕捉多粒度动态并维持长程时间一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法可以显著提高神经PDE求解器的长期预测性能和稳定性，特别是在复杂动态系统场景下。

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers offer a powerful tool for modeling complex dynamical
systems, but often struggle with error accumulation over long time horizons and
maintaining stability and physical consistency. We introduce a multiscale
implicit neural emulator that enhances long-term prediction accuracy by
conditioning on a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations.
Drawing inspiration from the stability properties of numerical implicit
time-stepping methods, our approach leverages predictions several steps ahead
in time at increasing compression rates for next-timestep refinements. By
actively adjusting the temporal downsampling ratios, our design enables the
model to capture dynamics across multiple granularities and enforce long-range
temporal coherence. Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics show that our
method achieves high short-term accuracy and produces long-term stable
forecasts, significantly outperforming autoregressive baselines while adding
minimal computational overhead.

Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型训练中由于地理分布的加速器而导致的区域间通信成本高和异构硬件利用率不均的问题。

Method: 引入区域内本地参数服务器（LPS）和区域间的全局参数服务器（GPS）进行层次化异步优化框架。

Result: HALoS在地理分布的LLM训练中比同步基线快7.5倍，并比现有异步方法快2.1倍，还保留了模型质量。

Conclusion: HALoS框架在异构、地理分布环境下实现了大规模语言模型的可扩展、有效训练，显著降低了总训练时间，同时保持或超过完全同步的随机梯度下降的准确性。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed
environments.

TL;DR: NOBLE is a new deep learning framework that efficiently models neuron dynamics, capturing variability and achieving over 4200 times speedup in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current neuron modeling approaches that struggle with variability and scalability, and to harness deep learning for better capturing neural dynamics.

Method: The method involves using a neural operator framework called NOBLE to learn mappings from frequency-modulated embeddings of neuron features to predict somatic voltage response, based on biophysically realistic neuron models.

Result: NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics, achieving a significant speedup over traditional numerical solvers, and is consistent with experimental observations of neural responses.

Conclusion: NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties and provides insights into cellular composition, computations, and potential applications in neuromorphic architectures and neuroAI.

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

TL;DR: Neural MJD improves time series prediction for non-stationary data by introducing a neural SDE model, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of deep learning methods in generalizing to non-stationary data and explicitly modeling stochastic processes, particularly when abrupt changes are present in the data.

Method: The method involves formulating forecasting as a stochastic differential equation simulation problem, combining time-inhomogeneous Itô diffusion for non-stationary dynamics and a compound Poisson process for abrupt changes. A likelihood truncation mechanism is used for learning, alongside an Euler-Maruyama with restart solver.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Neural MJD outperforms existing deep learning and statistical methods in handling non-stationary data during forecasting.

Conclusion: Neural MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical learning methods in time series prediction for non-stationary data, especially with abrupt changes.

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled
datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate

In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning

rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of

TL;DR: 通过聚类输入数据并使用中位数统计来生成高质量的私密合成文本，同时降低隐私成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的均匀采样方法会降低私密生成文本的质量，尤其是当敏感示例涉及异质主题时。

Method: 提出了一种新的算法，通过在推断之前对输入数据进行聚类，再使用中位数而非平均值来私密计算下一个令牌统计数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在表现力指标以及下游任务性能方面有所提升。

Conclusion: 这种方法可以在显著降低隐私成本的情况下生成高质量的合成数据。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种用于模型和数据集比较的缩放定律推导方法，并对CLIP和MaMMUT两种语言视觉学习模型进行了全方位的比较。结果表明，MaMMUT在规模上有更好的性能提升和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可迁移学习研究中，规模定律被用于预测基础模型在更大规模上的性能。本文提出利用缩放定律推导进行模型和数据集比较，以决定哪个预训练过程更优。

Method: 本文首次对CLIP和MaMMUT两种使用对比损失或对比和字幕生成损失的语言视觉学习过程进行了全方位的缩放定律推导，确保对留出点的预测准确度。通过不同的下游任务和开放数据集验证对比的有效性，并以恒定学习率的缩放定律推导降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 精确的缩放定律推导为跨尺度比较模型和数据集提供了手段，避免了仅以单一参考尺度测量导致的误导性结论，为开放基础模型和数据集的系统比较和改进铺平了道路。

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

Method: 理论和实验研究分析图对称化对解释忠实度的影响，以及保留方向语义如何改善解释质量。

Result: 保留方向语义显著提高了解释质量，确保为人类决策者提供更精准的洞察。

Conclusion: 在安全关键应用中，需要使用具有方向意识的图神经网络解释工具，以提高解释的忠实度。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical domains, where
reliable explanations are vital for supporting human decision-making. However,
the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information,
leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our
analysis demonstrates how this practice compromises explanation fidelity.
Through theoretical and empirical studies, we show that preserving directional
semantics significantly improves explanation quality, ensuring more faithful
insights for human decision-makers. These findings highlight the need for
direction-aware GNN explainability in security-critical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出使用双向界限来稳定能量模型训练并提高密度估计质量，成功避免了传统训练方法中出现的不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能量模型虽然框架优美但训练较难，近期工作将其与生成对抗网络联系起来，利用变分下界进行训练，然而这种下界往往导致不稳定性。为此，本文提出了利用双向界避免这种不稳定性的方法。

Method: 在训练能量模型时，我们通过最大化下界和最小化上界来稳定训练。其中，我们提出四种对数似然的界限，基于生成器Jacobian的奇异值和互信息来推导下界，通过类似梯度惩罚的方法和扩散过程来推导上界，并为这些界限提供了评估算法。

Result: 对比不同界限，我们探讨了各种方法的优缺点并证明了双向界限的使用能够稳定EBM训练。

Conclusion: 我们通过使用双向界，不仅可以稳定EBM的训练过程，还能实现高质量的密度估计和样本生成。

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Conclusion: 研究表明使用动态规划和联合界限近似方法，可以有效地在代理图中找到近似最优的代理组合策略。

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical model that addresses the economic trade-off between
cost per token versus serial token generation speed when deploying LLMs for
inference at scale. Our model takes into account arithmetic, memory bandwidth,
network bandwidth and latency constraints; and optimizes over different
parallelism setups and batch sizes to find the ones that optimize serial
inference speed at a given cost per token. We use the model to compute Pareto
frontiers of serial speed versus cost per token for popular language models.

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

Conclusion: 本文挑战了以往关于过度平滑是GNNs特有问题的观点，并通过实验证明深度GNN层可以通过经典解决方案成功堆叠，而不影响性能。

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

Conclusion: 通过利用标签关系的抗噪性和标签连通性，可以提高特征选择方法的性能，从而提高模型在高维情况下的分类能力。

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 本文提出FedAPM框架，通过增强拉格朗日函数减少客户端漂移。实验表明其在不同数据集上的性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中，来自不同设备的数据集往往不是独立同分布的，并且客户端间存在多种数据模态，使得使用单一模型变得不切实际。部分模型个性化可以有效解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于交替方向乘子法（ADMM）的联邦学习框架，称为FedAPM。通过在目标中加入一阶和二阶近端项构建增强拉格朗日函数，以减少客户端漂移。一阶项提供局部和共享模型间的补偿修正，二阶项提供固定修正。

Result: FedAPM在四个异构和多模态数据集上的实验中表现优异，相较于现有方法提升12.3%测试准确率，16.4% F1分数和18.0% AUC，同时减少了通信轮次。

Conclusion: FedAPM通过显式估计拉格朗日乘子，比其他联邦学习框架在收敛性方面更稳定和高效。其训练可以从任意初始点全局收敛到稳定点，且取得恒定、线性和亚线性三种速率。

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

Motivation: 随着过参数化模型的普及，仅靠训练误差难以提供足够的泛化性能信息。同时，虽然平滑性与各种设置下的改善泛化性能有关，但在神经网络中直接施加平滑性仍具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了名为DIPNet的框架，该框架通过将输入投影为每层的可学习分布来实现更光滑的损失地形，从而促进更好的泛化。

Result: 理论分析表明，DIPNet减少了局部平滑性测量和网络的Lipschitz常数，改善了泛化性能。通过实验验证，DIPNet在包括视觉变换器、语言模型、ResNet和MLP在内的多种架构和任务中提高了测试性能。

Conclusion: DIPNet可以改善现代深度学习模型的一般化性能。这个方法不仅能无缝集成到现有模型中，而且在标准设置、对抗攻击、分布外输入和推理基准方面都显示出增强的效果。

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: RLVR主要通过优化选择高成功率的推理模式来提升模型推理能力，其训练收敛速度与模型初始能力相关，并可通过预先SFT来改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在提升模型能力方面取得了显著成功，但其提高推理能力的机制仍不清楚。因此，本研究旨在系统性地探索具有可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR），以了解其对推理能力的影响。

Method: 研究采用了一种系统的分析方法，结合理论分析和实验验证，研究了使用RLVR训练模型时推理模式选择的优化。具体而言，通过理论分析研究了RLVR的收敛性和训练动态，并检验了模型的梯度流动。

Result: 研究结果表明，使用RLVR训练的模型倾向于采用高成功率的推理模式，同时大体保持个别模式的稳定性。此外，研究还发现RLVR的收敛速度与模型的初始推理能力有关，较强的模型收敛较快，而较弱模型则较慢，但可以通过在RLVR之前应用监督微调（SFT）来改善。

Conclusion: 本研究加深了对强化学习在大模型微调中作用的理论理解，并为进一步增强推理能力提供了见解。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用卫星数据的机器学习框架来分类孟加拉国38个地区的干旱严重程度，强调了机器学习模型在识别和预测干旱条件方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统干旱指数常常忽视土壤湿度和气温等关键因素，机器学习模型在孟加拉国干旱预测中的应用缺乏跨多个地区卫星数据的全面整合。

Method: 使用无监督算法（如K-means和贝叶斯高斯混合）进行聚类，然后通过分类模型（如KNN、随机森林、决策树和朴素贝叶斯）进行分类。

Result: 该框架有效地分类了干旱严重程度，并展示了不同区域干旱易损性显著的差异性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于卫星数据的机器学习框架，成功在孟加拉国的38个地区中分类干旱严重程度。

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种新的名为dual-ISL的目标函数，用于训练隐式生成模型，该方法相比传统的生成模型方法具有优势。

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

Motivation: 随着生成模型变得越来越强大和普及，为了应对隐私问题、法律要求或纠正有害内容，能够遗忘特定数据的重要性日益增强。

Method: 采用损失梯度正交化的方法开发快速遗忘算法。

Result: 算法在MNIST和CelebA数据集上实现了遗忘数据，同时保持了原始模型的忠实性，并比现有的方法如梯度手术具有数量级更快的遗忘速度。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于损失梯度正交化的快速遗忘算法，其能够比现有方法更快速地实现数据遗忘，同时保持原始模型的质量。

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

*Fei Ding,Baiqiao Wang,Zijian Zeng,Youwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGRPO improves upon GRPO by adding a corrective second layer, enhancing reasoning and stability in LLMs without densely-annotated rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of intermediate supervision in GRPO leads to inefficient exploration dynamics and instability due to error propagation in reasoning chains.

Method: MGRPO introduces a two-layer mechanism where the first layer uses standard GRPO to generate an initial response and the second layer, trained to correct errors, creates a self-correction loop.

Result: MGRPO achieves superior performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks by providing process-level supervision through error correction rewards.

Conclusion: MGRPO significantly outperforms standard GRPO in mathematical reasoning benchmarks, enhancing both reasoning and self-correction abilities.

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer中的注意力机制在计算和内存复杂度上的瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出了一种称为log-linear attention的新注意力机制，通过用对数增长的隐藏状态集替代固定大小的隐藏状态，均衡了线性注意力的效率和softmax注意力的表现力。

Result: 证明了log-linear attention可以通过一个特定的增长函数获得类似于矩阵乘法丰富的并行形式，其计算成本在序列长度上是对数线性的。

Conclusion: log-linear attention在效率和表现力之间达到了平衡，并且在应用于Mamba-2和Gated DeltaNet等结构时表现良好。

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at

TL;DR: 本文改进了重尾奖励随机线性赌博任务中关于$d$的依赖，通过新的消元算法降低了上界，在某些几何结构中进一步减少了对$d$的依赖，并首次为某些核函数设置了次线性后悔度界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了改进重尾奖励线性赌博问题中$d$的依赖性，并在各个参数条件下，获得更紧的上界和下界。

Method: 提出了一种基于实验设计的消元算法，通过改进奖励上界，提高了对$d$的依赖性能。

Result: 实现了一个后悔度为$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$的算法，并且证明了$\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$的下界，同时引入了新的后悔度上界和下界，对某些几何结构在$d$的依赖性上进行了进一步的优化。

Conclusion: 本文在具有重尾奖励的随机线性赌博中，提出了一种新的消元算法，并对其进行了一定的分析和优化，特别是在$d$的依赖性上进行了改进。

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

Conclusion: 通过二次无约束二进制优化（QUBO）的视角，揭示了基于k-中心点和核密度估计（KDE）这两种矢量量化方法之间的结构关系。

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

TL;DR: 研究揭示Adam优化器中的自适应预处理器会导致训练不稳定性及损失峰值，通过实验验证机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了理解在使用Adam优化器时神经网络训练期间出现的损失峰值现象的机制。现有解释主要关注于损失景观的特征，本研究则聚焦于Adam算法本身的预处理器对这些现象的影响。

Method: 通过选择不同类型的神经网络架构（如全连接网络、卷积网络和Transformer架构）进行实验，揭示优化器预处理器的行为以及此行为如何影响损失曲线。

Result: 分析表明，Adam优化器的预处理器在固定梯度的情况下，会导致二阶矩估计的指数衰减，从而对当前梯度响应迟缓。在这种情况下，预处理Hessian的最大特征值可能会超过稳定性阈值$2/\eta$，导致神经网络训练的不稳定性和损失峰值。

Conclusion: 通过分析称为“Adam spikes”的现象，我们能够更好地理解在不同架构和规模的神经网络中常见的训练不稳定性。我们发现Adam优化器的自适应预处理器是导致这些不稳定的一个因素。这种理解为未来开发更稳定的优化算法提供了基础。

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: 通过在逻辑谜题上的强化学习训练，增强了LLMs的内部推理能力，实现了更强的组合泛化能力，而不依赖于特定任务的符号工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting

often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of

EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into

while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming

Conclusion: 本文提出的混合模型成功解决了传统SAEs和VAEs在特定任务中的缺陷，并在多种领域中展现出卓越的性能。

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于存在模态特定的信息，现有的对比损失未能有效地学习对齐的表示空间。

Method: 通过信息瓶颈原理的理论描述和对比损失中引入一种基于变分逼近的正则化项。

Result: 实验证明增加的正则化项有助于提高表示之间的对齐度。

Conclusion: 提出的正则化项能够有效改善对比损失在多模态表示学习中的表现。

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

TL;DR: 提出最小概念瓶颈模型（MCBMs），通过信息瓶颈约束使表示更具针对性，提高模型可解释性和干预有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）虽然能够预测具体概念，但不能确保其编码仅涉及到该概念的信息，这对可解释性和干预程序的有效性造成了疑虑。

Method: 提出最小概念瓶颈模型（MCBMs），结合信息瓶颈（IB）目标，通过在训练损失中加入变分正则项来约束每个表示组件，使其仅保留与对应概念相关的信息。

Result: MCBMs支持具备理论保障的概念级干预，并与贝叶斯原则一致，同时在设计选择上提供更大灵活性。

Conclusion: MCBMs provide theoretical guarantees for concept-level interventions, maintain consistency with Bayesian principles, and offer greater design flexibility.

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

Motivation: 髋关节发育不良是髋关节骨关节炎的风险因素，早期诊断发育不良对于进行手术干预以降低髋关节骨关节炎的风险非常重要。

Method: 使用192例CT扫描数据，其中100例用于模型训练，92例用于测试。结合高斯过程潜变量模型和同胚变换框架创建统计形状模型，即高斯过程同胚统计形状模型（GPDSSM）。

Result: GPDSSM模型不仅提高了分类准确性（AUC从91.2%提高到96.2%），还节省了临床医生手动测量角度和解释二维扫描的时间。

Conclusion: GPDSSM模型能够有效地区分髋关节发育不良样本与正常样本，并在分类准确性上优于传统的角度测量方法。

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Abstract: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is crucial for directing
limited medical resources. We introduce ALFIA (Adaptive Layer Fusion with
Intelligent Attention), a modular, attention-based architecture that jointly
trains LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting
mechanism to fuse multi-layer semantic features from a BERT backbone. Trained
on our rigorous cw-24 (CriticalWindow-24) benchmark, ALFIA surpasses
state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC while preserving a balanced

capturing both fine-grained clinical cues and high-level concepts, enable
seamless pairing with GBDTs (CatBoost/LightGBM) as ALFIA-boost, and deep neuro

Motivation: 工业自动化的发展需要减少复杂性，尤其在工业4.0中，因此该研究提出了一种将Agentic AI与意图为基础的范式相结合的概念框架，以简化人机交互（HMI），并更好地将自动化系统与工业5.0的以人类为中心、可持续和弹性原则对齐。

Conclusion: 这项研究证明了意图驱动的自动化框架在实现可扩展、以人类为中心的自动化方面的潜力，尽管存在数据质量和可解释性方面的问题。

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large
language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities,
enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction
(HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable,
and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,
the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous
decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the
potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable,
intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

TL;DR: FPTQuant通过四种新颖的变换实现高效量化，加速接近4倍，精度优于大多数方法，且对推理几乎无额外开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型（LLM）在推理阶段需要大量计算和能源，尽管权重和激活量化可以提高效率，但简单量化往往因为极大值异常点导致性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出了一种名为FPTQuant的新方法，包含四种新的轻量且表现力强的保函数变换，以促进transformers的量化：可合并的预RoPE变换、用于值的可合并变换、MLP块内的可合并缩放变换以及廉价的动态缩放变换。FPTs通过利用transformer的固有等变性与独立性，调整中间激活分布以适应量化需求。

Result: FPTQuant实现了静态INT4量化，几乎不产生推理开销，达到了SOTA的速度提升，最高可达3.9倍。实验证明该方法在精度速度的权衡方面表现出色，与以往大多数方法持平或更好，仅较慢29%的方法精度略低。

Conclusion: FPTQuant方法实现了静态INT4量化，且开销极小，在保留模型功能的同时，加速可达3.9倍。该方法在精度和速度的权衡上表现出色，接近或超过大多数现有工作，且相比慢29%的方法，其精度仅略低。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

Motivation: 展示通过学习者的自适应节奏加速无悔学习并不是一个孤立现象。

Method: 通过调整学习者的节奏，在不增加计算复杂度的情况下加速正则化学习，并且保持学习者之间的不耦合性。

Result: 在自我博弈中实现近乎最优的O_T(logT)后悔，并在对抗场景中保持最佳的O(sqrt(T))后悔。在没有依赖单调步长的情况下展示了快速学习的新路径。

Conclusion: 提出了一个名为"谨慎乐观主义"的新框架，能够加速通用游戏中的正则化学习并实现近乎最优的无悔学习。

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

TL;DR: CREAM models combine concept reasoning with competitive task performance, utilizing expert-defined relationships and a regularized side-channel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a model that maintains high concept importance and performs competitively on tasks by explicitly encoding relationships, enabling desired reasoning and mitigating concept leakage.

Method: CREAM embeds concept-concept and concept-task relationships as defined by human experts and uses a regularized side-channel for task predictions.

Result: CREAM achieves task performance on par with black-box models, relies mainly on concepts, facilitates model interventions, and reduces concept leakage.

Conclusion: CREAM models perform comparably to black-box models while primarily relying on concept-based reasoning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

Conclusion: MPP编码方法具备了形状中心性和连续性，能够基于几何特征区分空间对象，并能以高精度捕捉成对空间关系，性能优于基于光栅化的替代方法。

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is

Conclusion: 引入的TIMING方法在保持理论性质的同时，增强了IG的时间意识，实验表明在合成和真实世界时间序列基准上表现优于现有的XAI基线。

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，iN2V平均提高节点分类1分，个别数据集提升可达6分。

Conclusion: iN2V提高了节点分类性能，能够在归纳场景中有效利用传播嵌入。

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without
features or to supplement existing features with structure-based information.
Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which
restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to
reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/Foisunt/iN2V .

Method: 提出了D3M算法，基于预测模型的分歧进行监测，在非劣化转变下实现低误报率，并对劣化转变提供高真阳性率的样本复杂性界限。

Result: 在标准基准和实际大规模内科数据集上的实验证明了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: D3M算法有效监测部署后模型性能的劣化，可用于高风险机器学习流程的预警机制。

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

Conclusion: NIMO模型成功结合了神经网络的非线性校正能力与线性模型的可解释性，且在回归和分类场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了HiPPO理论以处理测量噪声，提升了状态空间模型的抗噪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HiPPO假设数据无噪声，但在实际中常常不成立，因此需要扩展HiPPO理论以解决这一假设的问题。

Method: 将HiPPO理论扩展到具有测量噪声的情况，并推导出一种考虑不确定性的状态空间模型动态初始化方法。

Result: 推导出不增加运行时间的情况下，从数据推断潜在系统后验的动态初始化方法，并在实验中验证了其对噪声的抵抗能力改进。

Conclusion: 我们的初始化改进了状态空间模型在训练和推理时对噪声的抵抗能力。

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过非参数平滑和重要性采样修正来稳定化训练的核化KL散度估计器，比现有方法更低的梯度方差，优化更稳定和高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练半隐性变分推理方法在高维环境下由于较高的方差和偏差而具有挑战性。尽管现有的最先进的方法如KSIVI已证明在高维环境中有效，但训练仍然费用较高。

Method: 我们提出了一种核化的KL散度估计器，通过非参数平滑稳定化训练过程。此外，为了进一步减少偏差，我们引入了重要性采样修正。我们还提供了与Stein变分梯度下降的理论联系。

Result: 实证结果表明，我们的方法在性能和训练效率方面均优于或匹配当前最先进的SIVI方法。

Conclusion: 我们的半隐性方法在实现更低的梯度方差的同时，在函数空间中的偏差也是良性的，从而导致了更稳定和高效的优化。

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

Motivation: 尽管经验研究表明合成数据可能具有隐私增强效果，但仍缺乏严格的理论理解。为了填补这一空白，本文以线性回归为框架研究此问题。

Method: 使用线性回归作为研究框架，通过理论分析和数学证明来探讨合成数据的隐私增强特性。

Result: 虽然有消极的结果表明在特定情况下合成数据可能泄露大量信息，但也有积极的结果展示了合成数据可以超越生成模型的隐私保证。

Conclusion: 通过线性回归框架研究生成模型生成的合成数据的隐私特性，发现对抗者控制生成模型的种子时单个合成数据点可能泄露与模型本身一样多的信息，但随机输入生成有限数量的合成数据可以超越模型固有的隐私保证。

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

Abstract: Recently, federated learning frameworks such as Python TestBed for Federated

have emerged to tackle user privacy concerns and efficiency in embedded
systems. Even more recently, an efficient federated anomaly detection
algorithm, FLiForest, based on Isolation Forests has been developed, offering a

while maintaining a memory usage below 160 KB during model training. These
results highlight its suitability for resource-constrained environments and
edge systems, while upholding federated learning principles of data privacy and

Conclusion: \name方法显著提高了Qwen-2.5-Math的测试基准平均Pass@1准确性，表现优于GRPO，并在减少响应长度的同时提高了效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness
and efficiency. Our code will be available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LPMT框架通过热力学马尔可夫过渡过程，提升了实例检索任务的局部和全局的效果，是一种有效的扩散重排序方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散重排序方法虽然在亲和图中通过相似性传播来建模数据流形，但随着距离源几步，正信号会减弱，降低了局部区域之外的辨别力。因此，提出了局部保持马尔可夫过渡（LPMT）框架。

Method: 首先，通过双向协作扩散（BCD）整合不同图上的扩散过程，建立强大的相似性关系。然后，通过局部状态嵌入（LSE）将每个实例编码为分布，以增强局部一致性。这些分布通过热力学马尔可夫过渡（TMT）过程相互连接。

Result: 通过多种任务的实验结果，证实了LPMT在实例检索任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: LPMT框架在实例检索任务中的有效性得到了实验结果的确认，能够在保持局部有效性的同时，实现高效的全局检索。

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

Result: 研究成功构建了一种变压器架构，能够在不进行新的权重更新的情况下，仅凭几个上下文示例实现可靠的任务预测。这种方法摆脱了对优化算法有效性的依赖，适用于非凸问题和线性函数类之外的广泛情况。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，变压器可以通过我们的构建方法，在不进行进一步权重更新的情况下，仅凭几个上下文示例来进行可靠的预测。这表明变压器不仅能学习通用的表示，还能动态适应上下文示例。

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

Conclusion: 通过引入HAR对比损失和SHARP实验框架，可以有效减轻图神经网络中的度偏差问题。从理论和实验结果来看，SHARP在多个数据集上均优于基线方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

Motivation: 现有的分布式鲁棒核学习方案主要基于分而治之的方法，本文提出了一种统一的去中心化学习框架，以解决这些方法的不足，实现更高效的鲁棒回归。

Method: 提出了一种基于核的去中心化鲁棒学习算法，结合了重现核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）和网络系统，并使用核积分算子技术来得到收敛界。

Result: 算法为每个局部估计器在逼近回归函数时提供了高置信度的收敛界，证明算法可以在两个范数下达到几乎最优的学习速率，并说明了参数σ对增强鲁棒性和确保有利收敛的重要性。

Conclusion: 去中心化鲁棒核学习算法实现了在两个范数下达到最优学习速率，展示了去中心化、样本选择及算法鲁棒性与其收敛性之间的内在联系。

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于计算精确的Shapley值较为困难，通常需要指数级的模型评估，因此许多与模型无关的随机估计器被开发出来。其中影响最大和最常用的是KernelSHAP方法。然而对于KernelSHAP的理论界限一直未能明确，因此本文致力于为其提供理论保证。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种广泛和统一的框架，涵盖了KernelSHAP及其相关估计器，并为这些估计器提供了强大的非渐近理论保证。这是首次为KernelSHAP提供理论保证，并深入探讨现有估计器之间的权衡。通过对小型和中型数据集的决策树模型进行全面基准测试，我们验证了与精确Shapley值相比较的方法，其平均平方误差保持较低，并且样本量适中。此外，我们对实现进行具体改进，以提高方法在高维数据集上的可扩展性。最终结果在MNIST和CIFAR10数据集上表现优于KernelSHAP库。

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

TL;DR: 引入 Diagonal Batching，通过并行调度提升 RMTs 的推理速度，解决长上下文推理中的性能瓶颈，无需重训练，适用于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 RMTs 在长上下文推理中由于内存更新机制导致的顺序执行瓶颈问题。

Method: 引入了一种名为 Diagonal Batching 的调度方案，通过在 RMTs 中实现跨段并行性，同时保持完整的回归性，实现高效的 GPU 推理。

Result: Diagonal Batching 在 LLaMA-1B ARMT 模型中实现了 3.3 倍的速度提升（相较于标准完全注意力机制的 LLaMA-1B），以及在 131,072-token 序列上 1.8 倍的速度提升（相较于顺序 RMT 实现）。

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching 提升了 RMTs 在长上下文应用中的效能，使其成为实际应用中的可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

Method: 提出了一种逐步回火采样器与扩散（PTSD）方法，通过对不同温度下的扩散模型进行训练，并结合MCMC进行样本微调，提高神经采样器的训练效果。

Result: PTSD方法在样本信息的高效再利用和样本生成质量上表现出色，显著提高了目标评价的效率，并优于扩散式神经采样器。

Conclusion: PTSD方法能够生成混合良好、无相关性的样本，有效解决了当前神经采样器和PT方法的不足之处。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

Conclusion: 本文成功展示了RHEL在不同时间序列任务上的性能与BPTT相当，并为设计具有自学习能力的可扩展、节能的物理系统打开了新的大门。

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

Motivation: 分布式学习中的通信通常是一个主要的计算瓶颈，通过压缩信息来减少通信开销是常见的策略。需要对压缩通信后收敛性下降的问题做出适当补偿。

Method: 对错误反馈方案（特别是EF和EF^{21}）进行了严谨的分析，通过找到最优的Lyapunov函数来获得每种方法的最佳收敛率，同时提供了下界证明。这种方法能提供准确的性能保证和严格的对比分析。

Conclusion: 通过此分析，成功提供了EF、EF^{21}和压缩梯度下降之间的性能比较，并在简化设定中得到清晰的理论洞见。

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

Motivation: 当前时间序列生成的方法在确保生成序列特性的控制方面存在困难。为了在保留时间连贯性的同时进行精准的修改，提出了一种时间序列编辑框架（TSE），希望能在点水平约束和段水平控制上提供解决方案。

Method: CocktailEdit框架结合了两大关键机制：一种是基于信心加权的锚点控制用于点状约束，另一种是基于分类器的控制用于管理统计属性如段落的和与平均值。在去噪推理阶段实现了精确的局部控制，同时保持了时间上的连贯性，并能无缝整合到任何条件训练的基于扩散的时间序列模型中。

Conclusion: CocktailEdit框架实现了对时间序列在局部和整体层次上的精确控制，能够满足现实中时间序列编辑的需求，是与人类交互生成和编辑时间序列的灵活解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

Motivation: 为了解决基于Shapley值方法的计算复杂性，并免除每次测试样本再训练的高成本。

Method: 提出Fast-DataShapley，一种基于加权最小二乘法的一遍训练方法，能够训练一个可重用的解释模型，实现实时推理速度；同时提出三种具有理论保证的方法来降低训练开销。

Result: 实验评估表明，与基线相比，性能提高了2.5倍以上，解释器的训练速度提高了两个数量级。

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining accurate Shapley value calculations.

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: 储备计算可以在没有显性结构先验的情况下推广到状态空间的未探索区域。

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

TL;DR: SAILOR addresses BC's limitation by using L2S from expert demonstrations, outperforming BC methods in manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome BC's limitation, where agents can't recover from mistakes outside of expert demonstration support, by developing a method that enables reasoning in unseen situations to achieve expert outcomes.

Method: The method involves learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations using a world model and a reward model to allow for independent reasoning and recovery in unforeseen situations during test time.

Result: SAILOR consistently outperforms BC-trained Diffusion Policies across various benchmarks, identifies nuanced failures, and shows robustness to reward hacking.

Conclusion: SAILOR outperforms state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via behavioral cloning (BC) in visual manipulation tasks.

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

Conclusion: 本文通过理论和实证分析，揭示了不同测试时策略的样本效率，特别是自我一致性、选择最优的n和自我校正策略的有效性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

Motivation: 在GPU上进行大规模语言模型的高效推理面临挑战，主要是由于HBM和SRAM之间的数据传输的内存带宽限制。

Method: 提出了一种新的近似注意力方法SiftAttention，用基于阈值的计算效率的逐元素滤波操作替代昂贵的top-k步骤。

Result: SiftAttention在保持模型质量的同时，比现有的近似注意力方法更好地减少了加载值向量时的内存带宽使用。

Conclusion: SiftAttention能够比现有的近似注意力方法更好地减少内存带宽使用，同时保持模型质量。

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

Conclusion: 能量模型对图像的概率估计与训练集中特定图像几乎无关，同时图像概率和局部邻域的维度会随图像内容显著变化。

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of missing data in wearable sensor datasets, which affects self-supervised learning models that typically assume complete data inputs.

Method: The paper introduces Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM) within the second generation of Large Sensor Model (LSM-2), a self-supervised learning approach that learns representations from incomplete data without explicit imputation. AIM uses learnable mask tokens to handle missing data.

Result: LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best performance across various tasks such as classification, regression, and generative modeling. It also shows superior scaling performance and maintains high performance in scenarios with targeted missingness.

Conclusion: LSM-2 with AIM method provides a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data applications by effectively handling missing data and achieving superior performance across tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种AI框架，通过两步策略从QPI成像中有效提取核数据，实验显示该方法具有较高的准确性和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在量子材料中利用QPI成像揭示电子结构的过程中，从多散射体图像中提取单一散射体的QPI模式是一个固有的病态逆问题。为了解决这一问题，提出了AI框架来进行提取。

Method: 提出了一种两步学习策略，其中第一步使用变分自编码器训练学习散射核的紧凑潜在空间，第二步使用专用编码器将QPI观察的潜在表示与预先学习的核对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，与直接的一步基线方法相比，所提出的方法显著提高了提取准确性，并改善了对未见核的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于AI的框架来提取QPI核，实验结果证明该方法在复杂的散射条件下能够更准确地提取核数据，并且对未见的核具有更好的泛化性。

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

TL;DR: 文章重新评估测试时间缩放定律，提出稀疏注意力缩放范式，显示稀疏注意力在不同成本环境下的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作忽视了由于推理策略带来的内存访问瓶颈，导致对小模型有效性高估，故重新评估测试时间缩放定律。

Method: 研究采用了一种新的缩放范式，并进行了稀疏注意力模型与密集对比模型的性能对比实验。

Result: 稀疏注意力模型在低成本和高成本环境中的问题解决准确性分别提高了超过60点和5点。

Conclusion: 研究建议在TTS中关注比参数数目更为关键，稀疏注意力是充分实现测试时缩放潜力的关键。

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

Motivation: 展示自组织系统可演变到多重临界状态的能力，提供研究多重相变相关系统（如大脑）的统一框架。

Method: 研究了一个随机网络耦合振子模型，该网络拓扑根据振子动力学演变。

Result: 系统首先自组织到振荡起点，然后漂移到图案形成起点，同时保持在振荡的起点，实现两种不同方式的临界态。

Conclusion: 多重临界性是自组织临界态的一个更加多样化和广泛分布的特性，自组织系统可能普遍存在此现象。

Abstract: Self-organized criticality is a well-established phenomenon, where a system
dynamically tunes its structure to operate on the verge of a phase transition.
Here, we show that the dynamics inside the self-organized critical state are
fundamentally far more versatile than previously recognized, to the extent that
a system can self-organize to a new type of phase transition while staying on
the verge of another. In this first demonstration of self-organization to
multicriticality, we investigate a model of coupled oscillators on a random
network, where the network topology evolves in response to the oscillator
dynamics. We show that the system first self-organizes to the onset of
oscillations, after which it drifts to the onset of pattern formation while
still remaining at the onset of oscillations, thus becoming critical in two
different ways at once. The observed evolution to multicriticality is robust
generic behavior that we expect to be widespread in self-organizing systems.
Overall, these results offer a unifying framework for studying systems, such as
the brain, where multiple phase transitions may be relevant for proper
functioning.

Motivation: 現有的團隊優化工具缺乏動態性，難以適應個人成長和團隊動態變化，導致成員不滿足和績效下降。

Method: 多臂賭徒算法、大型語言模型使用於AI反饋助手和仿真框架。

Result: 提出了基於多臂賭徒算法的團隊組建框架，以及使用LLM提供即時反饋的tAIfa系統和仿真多代理團隊動態的PuppeteerLLM框架。

Conclusion: 論文提出了增強團隊滿意度、參與度和績效的AI輔助團隊優化框架及實用系統。

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用注意力模式的过滤方法来识别并过滤可能毒化的段落，提高了防御准确性，但更隐蔽攻击仍然有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有攻击并不隐蔽，易于检测和减轻，但为了提升攻击者效果，容易导致被检测。需要设计更隐蔽的攻击，以更好地操控模型的输出反应，而避免被检测。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于注意力模式的算法，即注意力方差过滤算法，使用标准化段落注意力分数来识别并过滤可能被毒化的段落。

Result: 使用我们的方法，可以在面对攻击时使准确性提高约20%，但我们也开发了更隐蔽的适应性攻击，使攻击成功率达到35%。

Conclusion: 提出了一种利用注意力模式的过滤方法，可以有效地识别和过滤可能被毒化的段落，提高了对现有攻击的防御能力。虽然可以提升至20%准确性，但面对更隐蔽的自适应攻击时，防御仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

TL;DR: 研究提出了使用差分隐私的DP-LoRA框架微调LLM进行放射学报告文本的多异常分类，在保持隐私的同时取得了接近非私有基线的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究提出了一种使用差分隐私技术微调大型语言模型的框架，以在保持分类性能的同时减轻与敏感患者数据相关的隐私风险和数据泄露风险。

Method: 使用Calibrated Noise的DP-LoRA技术对LLM进行微调，并比较了不同隐私预算下的模型性能。

Result: 我们在两个不同数据集和三种不同模型上观察到了明确的隐私-效用权衡。在适度隐私保证下，DP微调模型在MIMIC-CXR数据集上实现了0.88的加权F1分数，在CT-RATE数据集上为0.59，而非私有LoRA基准分别为0.90和0.78。

Conclusion: 使用Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)进行微调可以有效地实现隐私保护的多异常分类，从而解决了LLM在敏感医疗数据上微调的关键挑战。

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BESA是一种应对扰动防御的编码器窃取攻击方法，通过扰动检测和恢复，提升攻击性能，准确性可提高24.63%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升编码器窃取攻击的性能，应对基于扰动的防御机制，我们提出了一种名为BESA的增强型编码器窃取攻击方法。

Method: BESA由扰动检测和扰动恢复两个模块组成。扰动检测模块利用从目标编码器获得的特征向量推断服务提供商采用的防御机制。一旦检测出防御机制，扰动恢复模块利用精心设计的生成模型从扰动特征向量中恢复出干净的特征向量。

Result: 通过基于各种数据集的广泛评估，BESA在应对最先进的防御和多重防御组合时，显著提升了现有编码器窃取攻击的替代编码器准确性。

Conclusion: BESA显著提高了现有编码器窃取攻击在面对最先进的防御和多重防御组合时的替代编码器准确性，最多可提升24.63%。

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过使用大型语言模型和补充学习生成，可以自动进行攻击缓解策略合规，并且在精确性、召回率和F1评分方面有显著提高。

Abstract: The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing
sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a more robust, adaptive, and
automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context
learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how
our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于公开可用的Verilog代码量远不及Python等软件语言，增加Verilog代码量是为了提升在硬件代码生成任务中的表现。

Method: 通过将VHDL、Chisel和PyMTL3三种硬件描述语言转换或编译为Verilog，创建数据集hdl2v。

Result: 使用hdl2v提升了32亿参数模型在VerilogEvalV2任务上最多23%的性能（pass@10），以及通过数据增强的微调方法将性能提升了63%。

Conclusion: hdl2v数据集在增加Verilog代码量的同时，显著提升了大规模语言模型在Verilog代码生成任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better

TL;DR: Introduces a new method for anime sketch colorization using SSIMBaD in a diffusion-based framework, achieving better accuracy and quality than existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional methods in anime facial sketch colorization, which often compromise perceptual consistency, by preserving structural fidelity and effectively transferring stylistic attributes.

Method: We utilize a novel diffusion-based framework with a new technique called SSIMBaD (Sigma Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion) which uses a sigma-space transformation to align perceptual degradation linearly and ensure uniform visual difficulty across timesteps.

Result: Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset showed superior performance in terms of pixel accuracy and perceptual quality compared to existing models, with good generalization to various styles.

Conclusion: Our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and perceptual quality for anime facial sketch colorization and generalizes to diverse styles.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

Motivation: To enhance biological plausibility and improve model dynamics by facilitating neuron interaction within a grid-based structure, akin to biological neurons.

Method: This paper introduces a grid-based structure for neural networks, utilizing the Izhikevich model for efficient and biologically accurate simulations.

Result: The grid-based structure in combination with the Izhikevich model results in specialized but computationally efficient and accurate simulations.

Conclusion: The adaptation of the Izhikevich model into a grid-based structure enables improved dynamics and biological accuracy in neural networks.

Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN
model uses a grid-based structure to improve biological plausibility and the
dynamics of the model. The grid structure helps neurons to interact with their
closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen
in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate
simulation that can aid in the development of neural networks, large scale

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional GSA methods often produce long lists of pathways with irrelevant results due to lack of clinical context, requiring extensive manual interpretation which reduces reliability and reproducibility.

Method: cGSA incorporates gene cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to prioritize pathways in a context-aware manner.

Result: cGSA outperformed baseline methods by over 30% in specificity and accuracy when evaluated on gene sets across multiple diseases and mechanics, with the additional confirmation of expert validation.

Conclusion: cGSA is a more precise and interpretable approach for gene set analysis compared to conventional methods, especially in the context of various diseases.

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

TL;DR: 开发的扩散变压器去噪框架提高了低统计量蒙特卡洛剂量图的质量，实现了快速准确的剂量计算，虽然只在头颈癌数据上训练但在其他癌症类型中也表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强度调制质子治疗(IMPT)在头颈癌中提供精确的肿瘤覆盖，同时保护风险器官(OARs)。然而，其对解剖变化的敏感性要求通过在线自适应放疗(oART)进行频繁适应，这依赖于快速准确的剂量计算，而蒙特卡洛(MC)模拟是其中的方法。减少粒子计数可以加速MC，但会降低准确性，因此提出了一种给低统计MC剂量图去噪的方法以实现快速、高质量的剂量生成。

Method: 研发了一种基于扩散变压器的去噪框架。使用来自80名头颈癌患者的IMPT计划和3D CT图像生成噪声和高统计量剂量图。数据被标准化处理成统一块状，并通过零填充、归一化和转化为准高斯分布。模型训练时将噪声剂量图和CT图像作为输入，高统计量剂量图作为基准，通过结合的损失函数进行训练，包括均方误差(MSE)、残差损失和区域MAE。性能通过MAE、3D Gamma通过率和DVH指标进行评估。

Result: 模型在各疾病区域取得了满意的结果。头颈癌的MAE为0.195，肺癌为0.120，乳腺癌为0.172，前列腺癌为0.376。所有区域的3D Gamma通过率均超过92%, DVH指标与基准值非常接近。

Conclusion: 开发了一种基于扩散变压器的去噪框架，并虽只在头颈癌数据上训练，但在多个疾病区域有良好的泛化效果。

coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

### [272] [Memory-Driven Bounded Confidence Opinion Dynamics: A Hegselmann-Krause Model Based on Fractional-Order Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04701)
*Meiru Jiang,Wei Su,Guojian Ren,Yongguang Yu*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的分数阶有界置信意见动态模型，通过捕捉历史信息的持久影响来研究记忆效应，并展现了其收敛性、一致性及对意见演变的现实意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 记忆效应在社会互动和决策过程中起着关键作用，但现有模型在捕捉历史信息的持久影响方面存在局限性。

Method: 建立了一个基于Hegselmann-Krause框架和分数阶差分的新模型，并进行了严格的理论分析来研究其基本性质，如收敛和一致性。

Result: 研究结果表明该模型不仅在收敛性和一致性方面优于经典模型，还能更真实地表现现实情境中的意见演变过程。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅保持了经典意见动态模型的收敛性和一致性特征，而且解决了传统模型中有界意见单调性的问题。

Abstract: Memory effects play a crucial role in social interactions and decision-making
processes. This paper proposes a novel fractional-order bounded confidence
opinion dynamics model to characterize the memory effects in system states.
Building upon the Hegselmann-Krause framework and fractional-order difference,
a comprehensive model is established that captures the persistent influence of
historical information. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, the fundamental
properties including convergence and consensus is investigated. The results
demonstrate that the proposed model not only maintains favorable convergence
and consensus characteristics compared to classical opinion dynamics, but also
addresses limitations such as the monotonicity of bounded opinions. This
enables a more realistic representation of opinion evolution in real-world
scenarios. The findings of this study provide new insights and methodological
approaches for understanding opinion formation and evolution, offering both
theoretical significance and practical applications.

### [273] [Domain Adaptation Method and Modality Gap Impact in Audio-Text Models for Prototypical Sound Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04376)
*Emiliano Acevedo,Martín Rocamora,Magdalena Fuentes*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过整合背景声音的贡献，提高音频-文本模型的环境声音分类性能，无需再训练模型，同时缩小音频和文本的模态差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然音频-文本模型能在零样本环境声音分类中使用，但其在有背景声源时性能会显著下降。

Method: 提出一种新方法，通过量化和整合背景声音的贡献，提高分类性能。此外，通过分析音频和文本嵌入之间的模态差距，证明缩小这一差距可以提高分类性能。

Result: 在无需重新训练模型的情况下，该方法在各种背景和SNR条件下提高了准确性。这种方法在最先进的原型方法中表现出色，展示了其在不同环境中的可扩展性和稳健性。

Conclusion: 通过量化并整合背景声音贡献的创新方法，改善了音频-文本模型在不同背景和SNR条件下的分类性能，无需对模型进行再训练。

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

*Hien Ohnaka,Yuma Shirahata,Byeongseon Park,Ryuichi Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过显式和隐式字形条件来生成一致性更高的语音标签的方法，实验表明其在字形一致性和口音估计准确性上均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获得与字形一致的语音音素和韵律标签，以便用于下游任务如文本到语音转换和文本口音估计。

Method: 1) 使用预训练的BERT特征通过提示编码器添加隐式字形条件。2) 在推理过程中显式修剪与字形不一致的标签假设。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的方法显著提高了字形与预测标签之间的一致性，并在口音估计任务中有效提升了估计准确性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著提高了音素与预测标签之间的一致性，并有效提升了口音估计的准确性。

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

*Te Ma,Min Bi,Saierdaer Yusuyin,Hao Huang,Zhijian Ou*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes LLM-P2G, a new phoneme-to-grapheme decoding method for phoneme-based ASR, which surpasses traditional WFST-based systems in efficiency and accuracy in Polish and German.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve data efficiency and competitive results in phoneme-based ASR while overcoming the limitations of WFST-based decoding, such as a complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models.

Method: The paper introduces LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding, which replaces Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) decoding. It consists of two main components: speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). Additionally, it proposes two training strategies to mitigate information loss: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP) and randomized top-K marginalized (TKM) training and decoding.

Result: The proposed LLM-P2G method demonstrates better performance than WFST-based methods by achieving relative WER reductions of 3.6% for Polish and 6.9% for German.

Conclusion: LLM-P2G decoding outperforms traditional WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR for Polish and German, with significant reductions in word error rate (WER).

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

### [276] [Exp4Fuse: A Rank Fusion Framework for Enhanced Sparse Retrieval using Large Language Model-based Query Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04760)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse, a new framework for query expansion, outperforms existing methods by effectively combining original and LLM-augmented queries to improve sparse retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the challenges in improving information retrieval performance with LLM-generated documents, which often require complex and costly techniques. The goal is to mitigate these by exploring simpler query expansion methods.

Method: The paper introduces Exp4Fuse, a fusion ranking framework that uses zero-shot LLM-based query expansion indirectly. It evaluates both the original and LLM-augmented queries, generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever, and combines them with a modified reciprocal rank fusion method.

Result: Exp4Fuse demonstrates superior performance in enhancing sparse retrievers compared to other LLM-based query expansion methods, as verified through evaluations on MS MARCO-related and low-resource datasets.

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse outperforms existing LLM-based query expansion methods for sparse retrieval and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on several benchmarks when combined with advanced sparse retrievers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GOLFer方法利用小型语言模型进行查询扩展，通过幻觉过滤器和文档组合器的结合，实现了在信息检索任务中与大型模型竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大型语言模型的查询扩展方法在性能上过于依赖于模型的规模，导致成本高昂、计算密集且可访问性有限。为了克服这些局限性，提出了一种可以利用小型开源语言模型的新方法GOLFer。

Method: GOLFer方法由两个模块组成：幻觉过滤器和文档组合器。幻觉过滤器用于检测并去除生成文档中虚构和不一致的句子，而文档组合器通过使用权重向量将过滤后的内容和查询进行结合，以平衡它们的影响力。

Result: 实验结果表明，GOLFer在使用小型语言模型时，持续优于其他方法，并且在性能上与使用大型语言模型的方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: GOLFer方法在使用小型语言模型的情况下，能够在信息检索的查询扩展任务中表现出色，并能与使用大型语言模型的方法竞争。这表明GOLFer是一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 研究减少视觉文档检索模型内存使用，开发轻量化版本Light-ColPali/ColQwen2，显著降低内存占用并保持检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ColPali/ColQwen2在视觉化文档检索中表现突出，但其多重patch-level embeddings编码导致内存使用过大，亟需优化。

Method: 本文对比了两种减少页面patch embeddings的方法：token pruning和token merging，并开发了一种新的策略组合。

Result: Light-ColPali/ColQwen2在保留98.2%检索性能的同时，仅使用原内存的11.8%，在极低2.8%内存占用下仍保持94.6%有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的Light-ColPali/ColQwen2模型在大幅减少内存使用的同时，保持了较高的文档检索性能。

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

Motivation: 提供个性化文本转语音技术以帮助存在语音障碍的人群进行有效沟通。

Method: 研究人员对语音失用患者的语音进行重建，使用了一个大型语音模型（Parler TTS），并通过精细调整模型以学习处理数据分布。

Result: 结果显示模型可以学习复杂的数据分布，但在保持语音清晰度和说话者身份一致性方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，现有的语音模型在生成具有可辨识说话者身份的清晰语音方面仍存在困难，但有潜力通过进一步研究予以改善。

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

Conclusion: 通过系统比较不同的语音文本联合解码策略，最终发现交错方法在对齐方面表现最佳。然而，新的提前停止交错（ESI）模式能够显著加速解码，并稍微提升性能。

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However,

multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing,
regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally
robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion
datasets, using WavLM and XLSR representations, evaluate each method under
conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender
performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings
provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and
highlight the impact of dataset distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法准确理解复杂3D场景并动态推理指令指示的交互位置。

Method: 通过监督微调引入解耦的深度编码器以增强空间理解，采用强化微调进行多步推理的优化。

Result: 在RefSpatial-Bench上的平均准确率领先其他基线模型17.4%，达到89.6%的成功率。

Conclusion: RoboRefer在空间理解和多步骤推理任务中表现出色，大幅度超过现有基线模型。

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Motivation: 现有的基于规则和机器学习的方法需要具有深入BGP知识的专家来解释事件并提出解决方案，这对BGP异常的检测和解释造成了限制。

Method: BEAR框架利用大语言模型，通过一个多步骤推理过程，将表格形式的BGP数据转换为详细的文本叙述。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的评估显示，BEAR实现了100%的准确率，性能优于Chain-of-Thought和上下文学习基线。

Conclusion: BEAR框架利用大语言模型自动生成详尽的报告，解释BGP异常事件，从而提供了网络管理的有价值的操作见解。

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

TL;DR: 本文针对WiFi 7的动态信道分配问题，提出了LLM-BAI-MCTS算法，通过整合大型语言模型，大幅提升了收敛速度和网络普适性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于WiFi 7标准的引入，其中的多链接操作（MLO）功能在提高网络吞吐量和降低延迟方面提供了显著改进，但在密集网络环境中也带来了信道分配的挑战。当前研究多集中于静态WiFi 7网络配置中的性能分析和吞吐量优化，而动态信道分配问题尚待解决。

Method: 将动态信道分配问题视为一个组合优化问题，并提出了一种新颖的网络性能分析机制。利用多臂赌博机框架来进行在线学习最优信道分配，开发了BAI-MCTS算法（基于最佳臂识别的蒙特卡罗树搜索算法），并进行了严格的理论分析，提供样本复杂度和错误概率的上界。同时，提出了LLM-BAI-MCTS算法，将大型语言模型整合到BAI-MCTS算法中，以减少样本复杂度并增强多样化网络场景的普适性。

Result: 数值结果显示BAI-MCTS算法在达到98％的最优值时，其收敛速度比现有最先进的算法快约50.44％。此外，LLM-BAI-MCTS算法在密集网络中的收敛速度提升了超过63.32％。

Conclusion: 提出的LLM-BAI-MCTS算法有效解决了WiFi 7密集网络环境中的动态信道分配问题，证明了其优良的收敛性能和普适性，尤其在处理缺乏先验信息的密集网络环境中表现突出。

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

Motivation: 随着数字经济的发展，数据成为关键资产。然而，与在全球市场估值领先的OTT公司相比，移动网络运营商（MNOs）对数据的利用率较低。

Method: 本研究分析了70多篇文章中的趋势和空白，并提出了两个新的使用案例，旨在促进NWDAF的采用及其盈利可能性。

Result: 研究中的提案旨在推动对NWDAF的采用，并探索其盈利潜力。

Conclusion: 数据分析成为在连接商品化之外提供更大客户价值的战略推动力，尤其是在3GPP的NWDAF框架下。

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70
articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and
explore its potential for monetization.

TL;DR: 现有LLM危害测量工具常无法满足实际需求，需改进策略以提升实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更好地理解和解决LLM系统在实际应用中存在的表现性危害问题，并加强工具与研究人员需求之间的契合度。

Method: 通过与12名从事LLM系统评估的实践者进行半结构化访谈，以了解他们对现有工具的使用情况和需求。

Result: 研究发现当前的工具在实际应用中存在显著不足，提出了以测量理论和实用测量为基础的改进建议。

Conclusion: 尽管NLP社区提供了各种工具来衡量大语言模型（LLM）系统中的表现危害，但这些工具往往无法满足实际研究人员的需求。

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

Motivation: 研究人工智能代理系统的引入如何影响公共部门的监督机制，并探讨如何加强这些机制以应对新的挑战。

Method: 采用了一种混合方法，包括文献回顾和对AI相关职能的公务员进行的访谈。

Result: 发现代理监督在三个现有治理挑战上表现得更加激烈：持续监督、治理与操作能力的更深层次整合以及部门间协调。提出了适应机构结构的方法并设计了与公共部门限制相兼容的代理监督方案。

Conclusion: 人工智能代理系统的引入加剧了传统公共部门监督机制的现有挑战，这些机制依赖于孤立的合规部门和间歇性批准，而不是持续的、综合的监督。

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

Motivation: 简化现有解决最优控制问题的神经网络架构和训练流程。

Method: 提出使用简单的神经算子架构DeepONet，结合无约束优化流程，通过在训练阶段添加基于微分方程的惩罚项，并在优化过程中通过自动微分计算控制的梯度。

Result: 针对九个不同的最优控制问题，训练三个DeepONet模型，展示出在不同的成本函数下，所有情况均表现出准确且一致的性能。

Conclusion: 神经网络在解决最优控制问题中表现出色，通过不必要包含成本函数的训练过程，简化了架构。使用DeepONet和无约束优化流程可解决多个控制问题。

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

TL;DR: Gen-n-Val框架通过采用Layer Diffusion、LLMs和VLLMs生成高质量单对象遮罩和多样背景，有效解决数据稀缺和标签噪声问题，并提升了目标检测和实例分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在计算机视觉任务中，如目标检测和实例分割仍面临数据稀缺和标签噪声的问题。现有的合成数据生成方法存在多对象遮罩、分割不准确和类别标签错误等问题，限制了其有效性。

Method: 提出Gen-n-Val数据生成框架，利用Layer Diffusion、LLMs和VLLMs生成高质量、单对象遮罩和多样背景。包含两个代理：LD提示代理（LLM）优化生成高质量前景实例图像及分割遮罩，数据验证代理（VLLM）过滤低质量合成实例图像，系统提示通过TextGrad优化，使用图像融合结合多个场景实例。

Result: 较MosaicFusion等现有方法，我们的方法将无效合成数据从50%降至7%，在COCO实例分割上的稀有类别mAP提升1%，在开放词汇对象检测基准上对YOLO11m提升7.1%的mAP，并提高YOLOv9和YOLO11系列在实例分割和目标检测中的性能。

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val显著提高了数据的质量和生成效率，对实例分割和目标检测任务有积极影响。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

TL;DR: RSVP是用于统一多步骤多模态推理与视觉理解的新框架，提升了多模态大语言模型的视觉定位和分割能力，实验结果取得了显著的性能增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型缺乏视觉基础和分割的显式机制，导致认知推理与视觉感知之间存在差距。为了解决这一问题，引入了RSVP框架。

Method: RSVP采用了包含两个阶段的结构化框架，将推理驱动的定位与分割细化相结合。在推理阶段使用多模态的链式思维视觉提示帮助理解查询并推断目标。在分割阶段，使用视觉语言分割模块（VLSM）来优化提案，并生成精确的分割掩码。

Result: RSVP在ReasonSeg数据集上超越了最先进方法，gIoU提升了6.5，cIoU提升了9.2，在SegInW数据集的零样本环境下达到了49.7 mAP。

Conclusion: RSVP是一个有效且可扩展的框架，将认知推理与结构化视觉理解相结合，实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

TL;DR: 引入了一种新的多模态多图像推理基准MMRB，用于评估多图像推理能力。实验显示开源MLLMs在这方面表现不佳，尤其是奖励排名任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的能力增强，并在广泛应用中需要同时处理和推理多个图像。然而，现有的MLLMs测试基准主要集中在单图像视觉推理或多图像理解任务的最终答案评估，未充分探索MLLMs在多图像输入上的推理能力。

Method: 引入首个多模态多图像推理基准（MMRB），该基准设计用于评估跨多个图像的结构化视觉推理。MMRB包括92个子任务，涵盖空间、时间和语义推理，并通过GPT-4o生成和专家调整的多解决方案、链式思维风格的注释。提出了一种基于开源LLMs的句子级匹配框架，以支持快速和可扩展的评估。

Result: 实验表明，开源MLLMs在多图像推理任务中仍显著落后于商业MLLMs。此外，当前多模态奖励模型几乎无法处理多图像奖励排名任务。

Conclusion: 现有的开源多模态大语言模型在处理多图像推理任务上仍存在显著不足，尤其是在奖励排名任务中。

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

Motivation: To create a diverse and clinically authentic benchmark for visual question answering in chest radiology, addressing various core radiological reasoning skills and advancing AI's ability to mimic expert-level clinical reasoning.

Method: ReXVQA includes approximately 696,000 questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays, evaluating eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models. A human reader study with radiology residents was also conducted to compare AI and human performance.

Result: The best-performing model, MedGemma, achieved an 83.84% accuracy rate, surpassing the best human radiologist whose accuracy was 77.27%, indicating AI's superior performance in this task.

Conclusion: ReXVQA represents a significant advancement in the field of visual question answering for chest radiology, providing a new comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI systems' capabilities in radiological reasoning, surpassing even human experts in performance.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be

Method: 提出了一种名为PLUCC（使用背景线索进行冰球定位）的新方法，包含三个部分：上下文编码器、特征金字塔编码器和门控解码器。

Result: PLUCC在PuckDataset数据集上实现了最先进的检测性能，比之前的基线方法在平均精度上提高了12.2%，在RSLE平均精度上提高了25%。

Conclusion: PLUCC方法通过利用玩家的身体方向和位置作为线索，实现了在单帧中进行规模感知和背景驱动的冰球检测。

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

Result: 生成的图像能够在目标区域及不同被试的低级和高级视觉区域中可靠地产生活动反应，表明激活最大化技术可有效应用于DNN编码模型，能够灵活表征和调节人类视觉系统的反应。

Conclusion: 该研究通过解决替代方法中需要生成模型的局限性，展示了利用激活最大化技术能在DNN编码模型中成功应用，从而灵活地表征和调节人类视觉系统的反应。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在解决视觉自回归（VAR）建模中存在的问题，如图像质量降低和超线性增长的序列长度，并提高图像生成的速度和灵活性。

Method: 引入层次化掩码自回归建模（HMAR）作为新图像生成算法，通过下一个尺度预测和掩码预测，采用马尔可夫过程化简建模过程，并使用可控的多步掩码生成程序。还开发了高效的IO感知块稀疏注意力内核，以提高训练和推理速度。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256和512x512基准上，HMAR模型的性能与或优于参数匹配的VAR、扩散和自回归基准；训练和推理速度较VAR提升超过2.5倍和1.75倍，推理内存占用减少超过3倍。HMAR还提供了额外的灵活性，其采样计划可在无需重新训练的情况下更改，并可用于零样本图像编辑任务。

Conclusion: HMAR 提出了改进自回归建模的新方法，通过更有效的生成过程和更少的资源需求，解决了现有VAR模型的主要问题。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合特征翻译和对象分割的表示学习方法，并验证其在更现实的数据集上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建良好的表示是当前深度学习领域的挑战。传统的表示学习一般采用独立特征轴进行表示，然而这种方法无法处理条件独立性的问题。为了应对这些问题，研究者提出了一种基于Galois代数理论的新的分组分解方法。

Method: 研究者提出了一种结合特征提取和对象分割的方法，用于将Galois代数理论应用到更现实的情境中。具体是通过特征翻译代替像素翻译，并将对象分割表述为在同一变换下对特征进行分组。

Result: 该方法在一个包含真实世界对象和背景的实用数据集上进行了验证，证明其有效性。

Conclusion: 新的模型将更好地帮助理解人类对真实世界中的物体识别的发展过程。

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

TL;DR: 介绍了HoliSafe数据集和SafeLLaVA模型以全面提高VLM的安全性，并在实验中表现卓越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的VLM安全增强方法存在数据覆盖不足及架构创新有限的问题。这个研究旨在通过全面的数据集和新的模型架构解决这些不足。

Method: 提出了一种新的VLM，即SafeLLaVA，结合了可学习的安全元标记和专用的安全头，元标记在训练期间编码有害视觉线索，安全头提供可解释的有害分类。

Result: 实验证明SafeLLaVA在多种VLM基准中达到了最先进的安全性能，同时，HoliSafe基准揭示了现有模型的重要漏洞。

Conclusion: SafeLLaVA结合HoliSafe数据集和基准，为VLM的安全性提供了一个全面的方法，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Motivation: 探索LLAM内图像概念的表示方式，并增加线性特征多样性。

Method: 研究线性可解码特征和训练多模态稀疏自编码器（SAEs）。

Result: 成功展示不同模态跨层次图像表示，同时通过对模型输出进行有针对性的编辑证明特征具有因果关系。

Conclusion: LlaVA-Next中的图像概念表示多样化，且在更深层次上跨模态表示变得更加共享。

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Conclusion: This AI-assisted auto-labeling system, enhanced with SegGPT and domain-specific techniques, provides a viable alternative to manual labeling, maintaining performance while reducing annotation efforts.

Abstract: This paper presents an AI-assisted auto-labeling system for display panel
defect detection that leverages in-context learning capabilities. We adopt and
enhance the SegGPT architecture with several domain-specific training
techniques and introduce a scribble-based annotation mechanism to streamline

Motivation: 解决水下图像增强中的物理约束和语义结构保存问题。

Method: 提出了一种双流架构，将Jaffe-McGlamery物理模型与基于胶囊聚类的特征表示学习相结合进行水下图像增强。

Result: 在六个具有挑战性的基准测试中进行了大量实验，结果显示，与现有最佳方法相比，PSNR提高了0.5dB，而计算复杂度（FLOPs）仅为其三分之一；在计算预算类似的方法中，PSNR提升了超过1dB。

Conclusion: 通过无参数增强既能遵循水下形成约束，又能保留语义结构和细粒度细节。

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

Motivation: 挑战传统观点，探讨能否通过较小但高价值的数据集实现与充分语料库相媲美的多模态推理能力。

Method: 提出多模态推理的数据选择范式称为推理激活潜能（RAP），通过两种互补的估计器识别认知样本：因果差异估计器及关注置信度估计器。引入难度意识替换模块（DRM）提升推理复杂性。

Result: RAP方法在六个数据集上的实验表明，只使用9.3%的训练数据即可实现优越性能，并能降低43%以上的计算成本。

Conclusion: 认知样本触发的多模态推理比传统大规模数据集更有效，采用RAP方法能够高效识别并利用这些高价值数据。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前城市分析中通过图像或GIS获得的客观街道指标已成为标准，但无法充分捕捉对包容性城市设计至关重要的主观感知。

Method: 引入名为多模态街道评估框架（MSEF）的新方法，将视觉变压器（VisualGLM-6B）与大规模语言模型（GPT-4）融合，使用LoRA和P-Tuning v2进行参数高效调整。

Result: 模型在客观特征上达到了0.84的F1分数，与汇总的居民感知达成了89.3%的一致性，并在分层社会经济地理中得到了验证。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种城市感知建模的方法创新，并为寻求基础设施精确性与生活体验融合的规划系统提供了实用性。

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Motivation: 评估视觉语言模型对场景结构和语义的理解能力，并提供标准化的系统性评估框架。

Method: 引入CIVET框架进行系统性评价，通过受控刺激来测试视觉语言模型的理解能力。

Result: 测试结果显示，当前视觉语言模型只能准确识别有限的基本对象属性，其性能受对象在场景中的位置影响较大，且难以理解对象之间的基本关系。此外，相比人类标注者，这些模型的准确率仍存在差距。

Conclusion: 现有的视觉语言模型在识别对象属性和场景中对象之间的基本关系方面能力有限，并且对对象的位置非常敏感。与人工标注者相比，这些模型的表现仍未达到人类的准确性。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation

closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just

TL;DR: 研究提出通过设计模型架构而非训练数据来增强图像质量评估模型的抗扰性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统依靠数据驱动的方法来增强鲁棒性可能并不理想，因此需要寻找一种通过设计来实现鲁棒性的新方法。

Method: 通过重新设计图像质量评估模型的架构来抵御对抗性扰动，使用正交信息流和保持范数操作来稳定系统，并进行剪枝和微调。

Result: 得到了一种在建筑上具有鲁棒性的图像质量评估架构，不需要依赖对抗性训练且能抵御对抗性攻击。

Conclusion: 通过设计一种内在结构稳定的模型，可以增强对抗性攻击的鲁棒性，而无需进行对抗性训练或对原始模型进行重大更改。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

Abstract: This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in
reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative
inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the
development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key
challenges and ongoing concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and
reuse.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高QIP在多阶段鲁棒离散线性优化问题中的性能，在现有研究仅使用搜索方法的背景下，引入扩展方法。

Method: 采用了CEGAR技术的扩展方法，特别针对具有线性约束的多阶段鲁棒离散优化问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，新的扩展方法在特定实例中较现有的搜索方法以及状态最优的QBF扩展方法表现更优。

Conclusion: 引入了一种新的扩展方法来解决QIP，通过CEGAR技术实现，并证明在某些实例中优于现有的搜索方法。

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable
performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

TL;DR: 本文提出AbBiBench框架，通过抗体-抗原复合体评估抗体设计，同时发现结构条件逆折叠模型性能最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的抗体评价策略主要依赖于单独的抗体及其与天然抗体的相似性，而忽略了抗体与抗原结合的实际功能表现。因此，开发一种将抗体-抗原复合体作为评估单元的方法是有意义的。

Method: AbBiBench使用抗体-抗原复合体作为功能单元，通过测量复合体的蛋白质模型可能性来评估抗体设计与给定抗原结合的潜力。研究对比了14种蛋白质模型，并使用模型可能性与实验亲和力值的相关性来评价模型性能。同时，通过案例研究评估了顶尖模型的生成能力。

Result: 结构条件逆折叠模型在亲和力相关性和生成任务中均表现优于其他模型。

Conclusion: AbBiBench为抗体设计提供了一个统一的、生物学基础的评估框架，有助于开发更有效、功能感知的抗体设计模型。

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 医学数据的“潜空间假设”框架，提供个性化诊断和治疗的基础。面临挑战，但有可行的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据涉及多种模态，如基因组序列、视网膜照片、结构化实验室结果和非结构化临床叙述。这些模态虽然看起来迥然不同，但许多都编码了同一生理状态的信息。需要一种新的框架来统一和解释这些数据，以实现个性化诊断、纵向监测和量身定制的治疗。

Method: 提出了“潜空间假设”，将每个观察视为统一的、层次组织的流形的投影。这一几何表示中，个体的健康状态占据一个位置，疾病进展描绘一条轨迹，治疗干预对应一个有向向量。

Result: 通过在共同空间中解释异质证据，可以重新审视帕金森氏症或克罗恩氏症等常掩盖多种病理生理实体的疾病。揭示子轨迹和患者特异的变化方向，为个性化诊断、纵向监测和定制治疗提供了量化依据。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新的框架来解释不同的医学数据模态，强调个体病程的独特性，促进更精确的医学实践。尽管存在挑战，但提出了对策，如尺度感知编码器、纵向数据流的持续学习和基于扰动验证的方法。

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.
